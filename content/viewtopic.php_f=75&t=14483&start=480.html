I will speak as long as it takes, until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court.”</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />So are we going to extend this to all law enforcement? No one gets shot without first being found guilty by court?</div></blockquote><br />Does anyone have a response to this? I'm struggling to see how drones are different, from the perspective of habeas corpus and the rights of the killed, from other killings of American citizens on US soil. Is it more fair if the presumed criminal has an opportunity to fight back?</div></blockquote><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">This is in large measure a fear of new technology.</span>  'It makes killing easier and doesn't put US soldiers at risk'.  Isn't that the sort of thing that the Pentagon should be looking for?  The critics of the drones do not limit their complaints to the kiling of American citizens or the what-ifs? of a future AMerican citizen terrorist.  It is an objection to the use of drones even to kill Al Quaeda leaders in the Pakistan tribal areas and Yemen.  The cry is against collateral damage, even though the drones are known to drastically reduce collateral damage, compared to say calling in a fighter bomber strike. <span style="font-weight: bold"> This is basically Rand Paul plus the anti-any-military-action wing of the left, who were hoping that Obama would severely alter our foreign policy and military policy</span>.</div></blockquote><br />i'm not sure who you're responding to on this board with this line of strawman thinking. no one here has stated any of this, and it doesnt seem fair to paint it as such.</div></blockquote><br />I'm saying what the typical arguments are.  And yes, some on this board are saying that a drone can never be used to take out a terrorist who is an American citizen, even though it would be dangerous/impossible to arrest him and give him his due process rights.  I'm saying we never had this discussion, when it was an FBI or Marine sharpshooter taking out a terrorist or a dangerousg hostage taker.  A drone is not different in terms of rights.  In terms of collateral damage or targetting enemy leaders, we took out a whole restaurant full of innocent people, because we had intelligence that Saddam Hussein was there, just prior to the start of second Iraq war.  We even moved the start of war ahead to take that shot.  But that was done with a fighter bomber or cruise missile, not a drone, so it was okay.  I'm just saying this whole discussion of drones is silly.  EIther you can target people in certain war/terroism situations, or you can't.  To me, taking out a 9/11 terrorist with a drone, who is only laughingly an American citizen with no real connection to this country, is a lot easier decision than Waco, Ruby Ridge, or how the NYPD behaves on any given night -- think Diallo case and how much accountability existed there.  When we entrust public safety to individuals, they are going to be forced to make fairly quick life an death decisions.  For someone like Paul, to say there are zero circumstances where it would be lawful and prudent to use a drone to kill an American citizen terrorist on American soil is crazy.  If you want to throw out due process issues, we had better have unarmed police and FBI so that no alledged criminal is ever killed without a trial.  It's doubly silly because it is clear that the administration is not contemplating using drones to kill Americans in America.  This is just an issue of not giving away what may be needed in the future to defend this nation.</div>

It is established precedent in US and international law, that the citizenship of the enemy combatant does not confer additional rights in time of war.  You join AQ, you are a lawful target, whatever you are doing within AQ.  You can be a malcontent on permanent kitchen duty, but you are an enemy combatant.  You can be signed up to carry out attacks, plan attacks, or merely guard or drive around the guys who plan and carry out attacks.  If you are AQ or Taliban, you are a legit military target, and can be killed by any means chosen by our military.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>pacino wrote:</cite>We have killed plenty of people who were not verified as being terrorists.</div></blockquote><br />We certainly have killed people as collateral damage, when they were in or next door to houses into which AQ/Taliban personnel entered or who were traveling in vehicles with same.  On the other possible meaning of what you post, it really depends upon what you mean by 'terrorist' and 'verified'.  Certainly not all of the AQ/Taliaban targetted are terrorists, nor do they need to be.  An enemy combatant may be behaving totally properly according to laws of war and attacking only military targets.  That means that he is not a criminal.  It does not mean that he is not a legitimate target for attack.  I'm also assuming that some whom have been targetted have been mis-identified as AQ/Taliban, either because coalition ground forces misidentified who entered a house or vehicle or because the wrong house/vehicle was struck.  I think these mistargettings are a lot rarer with drone strikes than with the former technique, which would be to launch the same hellfire missile or small bomb from an aircraft or helicopter.  The advantage is that the drone can surveil the target for an extended time before attacking and the aircraft/helicopter cannot, both because there is no pilot at risk and because of increased loiter time and difficulty of being spotted while loitering.  Drones can spot enemy combatants laying IEDs, follow them back to their base of operations, and bomb them.  They can track them back to their leaders and bomb them.  If you are going to set a target of 'nobody not verified as a terrorist can be killed or the method of attack should not be used', then you really can't ever fight any wars.  I would like us out of Afghanistan sooner than planned and never approved of Iraq war, but once you're in you either get out or you fight to win.  Fighting to win means killing as many of the enemy, with as few losses of your own and civilians as possible.  Drones and snipers are ideally suited to these goals.  Some view them as somehow unsportsmanlike.  Killing an enemy combatant does not become more moral, because the enemy has a chance to shoot down and kill or capture the pilot doing the attacking.  To not put a pilot at risk is a good thing.</div>

Nor would showing he was AQ be difficult, since he proclaimed as much on his website and all available intelligence confirmed that he was an AQ in Yemen leader who advocated attacks against the US and west.  Nor was he some US tourist or Jane Fonda-type political protester overseas.  While eligible for US citizenship due to birth in the US to foreign nationals, he considered himself a national of his parents home country.  At best, he was a dual citizen with the US citizenship not primary.</div>
