If you have Trump winning PA the whole map changes. It is wild.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Yes, the 538 article from a few weeks ago has Trump's chances going to over 80% if he wins PA and I think he will win PA because they have spent a lot of time coming up with a plan to steal it.  If he steals this election, the country will burn. I think that's why you continue to see him attack urban areas.

It's already set up.<br /><br />But even without cheating, if he's got a 15% chance at all 3, then he's got a 45% chance to win one of them. If we get a 3% swing towards Trump with bad polling or GOP voters coming home to roost (which they almost always do), all those states propping up Biden's win % will disappear and we'll be down to the same 3 states again. It's hard to replace PA electoral votes without winning FL or needing multiple red states to turn blue. With his unpopularity on the coasts being off the charts, he could lose the popular vote by 5% and still sneak out the electoral win.</div>

People seem to forget, in the noise of Trump having lost the popular vote by nearly 3M votes and nearly 2 percentage points, that his electoral college victory was relatively robust.  If Biden does not flip states I and everyone should have reason to be dubious about his flipping - FL that broke right while almost the entire rest of the country broke left in 2018, AZ that hasn't voted blue since the 90s and has only 11 EVs anyway and thus is not enough to turn the thing around without some &quot;help,&quot; NC that has voted blue once in a wave election year in recent memory, GA which is even more like that than NC, IA that has loads of evangelicals to whom Trump will be a hero for flipping the court for Roe v. Wade, OH that has way more SW PA in it than SE PA - Biden MUST sweep all of PA, MI, and WI.  If Trump keeps his 2016 states outside of those three AND wins any one of those three, he wins.  MI and PA have embattled Democratic governors and large populations of extremely motivated angry white people.  Either of those states plus his other 2016 states outside of WI, PA, and MI give him a win.  If he only holds WI out of those three, and everywhere else from 2016, that's a tie, and a Trump win.  If he holds all three (granted unlikely), he can lose AZ and win.  He can lose AZ and WI if he holds PA and MI.  He can lose PA, WI, and MI if he picks up NV and NH (not impossible by any stretch) and holds everywhere else - that is 270 and a win.<br /><br />His path isn't great but it is entirely plausible.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I understand most of your pessimistic/this isn't over yet logic, but 2016 was not a relatively robust Electoral College win for President Trump.  Since 1980 there have only been three elections decided by under 100 electors: 2000 (5), 2004 (35), and 2016 (77).  President Trump won the election by barely scraping by in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</div></blockquote><br /><br />yep, by a combined 70K votes in all three states.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The point is that he only need one of the three to win.  He can even lose AZ so long as he holds any one of the three, though if WI is the one he holds that would require the House of Representatives voting and him holding on to the ME and NE single EVs he won in 2016 - neither of which seems implausible.<br /><br />I mean the thing I keep coming back to is his voters are really <span style="font-style: italic">threatened</span>.  He is a representation of their ids and they feel backed into a corner and <span style="font-style: italic">threatened</span>.  That Trump parade I spoke of drew thousands in Bucks County driving all up and down everywhere because a few hundred middle aged women decided to do a mini-women's march in Doylestown.<br /><br />They will do <span style="font-style: italic">whatever</span> is necessary to win because losing means the annihilation of themselves as they see it.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Yes, he just needs to win one of them and I really think he will win PA because it will go to SCOTUS. It's already set up.<br /><br />But even without cheating, if he's got a 15% chance at all 3, then he's got a 45% chance to win one of them. If we get a 3% swing towards Trump with bad polling or GOP voters coming home to roost (which they almost always do), all those states propping up Biden's win % will disappear and we'll be down to the same 3 states again. It's hard to replace PA electoral votes without winning FL or needing multiple red states to turn blue. With his unpopularity on the coasts being off the charts, he could lose the popular vote by 5% and still sneak out the electoral win.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Please expand on how it is already &quot;set up&quot; that the PA case will go to SCOTUS. Once the votes are counted there will be no distinction between those that were mailed in or those that were cast in person. Also, I doubt Biden is going to need the few ballots that trickle in after Election Day. Dems have done a good job of messaging &quot;VOTE EARLY.&quot;<br /><br />IF Trump has the lead after all ballots received by Election Day are counted, then there may be cause for concern. I think there is a better chance that Biden will have the lead from wire to wire.</div>
