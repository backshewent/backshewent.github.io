<br />Democrats hated GWB and didn't support him. I know some liberals that may have spontaneously combusted had they learned that GWB was coming to their kids school. Now, the Dems on this board would argue that he earned their rage. You call it tomato, I call it tomatoh.

<br />I may hang out with a very right leaning crew as my friends, dead serious and without malice called my one friend a reasonable liberal and contrasted him with me a hippie liberal. Oh well, I think it's a better than 50/50 shot I vote GOP in 2016 and if not then, surely by 2020.</div>

<br />
<br />So the Florida Republican chair spoke out for this. What's he, the 712th highest ranking republican in the US or the 713th? I can't remember. Most GOP leaders have stated the protests are pretty silly. I blame media coverage. This was a non-story that became a story. I don't think civilization is about to collapse.</div>

Apparently Bush I  <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/When-Bush-spoke-to-students-Democrats-investigated-held-hearings-57694347.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">caught some heat</a>as well.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />You seem like a smart guy, so I assume you're just getting you're kicks in and can distinguish between protests pointed against using government offices for electioneering (fair enough, and probably valid in both cases although I don't believe sufficient either time to make it inadvisable) and those directed toward parents who are advised that they need to protect their children from dangerous ideas-from their President.
<br />
<br />Jeff2sf's comment bewilders me. If this was just some normal spouting off on Sunday morning talk shows and c-span and the pages of the Washinggton Post, fine, it's a lot of hot air and it will pass. But as the parent of school-age children, I know that there is much more of a grassroots whispering campaign of fear, hate and disrespect that will linger and affect American civil life for a long time unless reasonable opposition voices speak against it. I'm still waiting for this.
<br />
<br />I see this as more a sign of the times, than as a partisan issue, but the article cited by cshort indicates that most of the protest arose AFTER the speech.I attribute this to the fact that Democrats, squirrely as ever, saw no profit in speaking out against a President addressing schoolchildren. That this seemingly Apple Pie issue is now one of contentiousness basically means that there are now no issues lacking contentiousness, and that's a shame.</div>

			<div class="content">The partisan backbiting by the fringe over this astounds me. I was raised to respect the office and holder of the US president regardless of my political views. I was instructed that I had the right to complain and comment, but in the end I need to respect the office of the presidency.
<br />
<br />The protestation around this is mind boggling. The speech was necessarily release early to put these fears aside, but the paranoia continued. The echos of the fool who pointed out that Castro spoke to the children as well continued. In summary, the stupidity continues.
<br />
<br />My school district let it be known that they would not air the speech because it is the first day. That is laughable as nothing gets done the first day, much less the first week. My son told me that they did nothing today, there was not homework, no writing, no math, essentially nothing at all. We, as parents, are free to expose him and discuss the speech with him. When back to school night rolls around I am sure that the school board representative will make his overtly political pitch over the intercom as he has every year he has been in office. 
<br />
<br />In the end, this divide is the continuation of a process of creating a learned behavior of disrespect and hate. Anyone who read the speech knows that this is not a political message, but a message to demand the best of yourself as a student. People just cannot put their political divisions aside and offer common respect to one another for a moment provide the road map to our national undoing as we hasten our slide into the abyss.</div>

Also strange to just turn your back on the stinking pile of dog poop economy dropped on all of us and have the party leadership in Congress take no responsibility for cleanup, even at urging of their own President, and then walk around the corner and ask why the other party's major hasn't cleaned up that smelly pile of poop, while their dog bounds happily by their side off its leash.

<br />
<br />FWIW, in probably the same way that the hardcore Jews who live here in Brooklyn hate &quot;Jews like me&quot; (the 98 percent nonobservant types) perhaps more than they do the gentiles, the true-believing righties probably would offer Werthless as a human sacrifice to their ever-angry gods even before gutting and setting ablaze those of us with more liberal views. 
<br />
<br />Libertarianism, which I think is a reasonably fair oversimplification of his beliefs, is utterly unworkable IMO, but it's vastly more coherent and worthy of intellectual respect than whatever the fuck mainstream Republicans are purporting to offer these days.</div>

<br />They sorta need the &quot;libruls&quot;.  Ian Gillan penned a lyric... &quot;the devil and the priest can't exhist if one goes away&quot;, it's kinda like that.
