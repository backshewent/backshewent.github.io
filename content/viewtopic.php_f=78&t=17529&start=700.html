Maybe you're thinking of smitty? But you're right, it was glib and i had planned to expand on it. I spent the 80s and early nineties living in areas of cities, first Baltimore, then Jersey City, then New York, then Philadelphia, all of which  were mixed racially and all of which were experiencing high rates of crime. I saw efforts, or in some places didn't see efforts, to attack this pervasive atmosphere. Some of these involved the application of computerized surveys to previously completely antiquated methods of tracking crime, some of these involved enforcement of violations  of minor criminal offenses, some of these just involved good community policing. And while it may make you sick to read differing opinions on this board, it made me sick when efforts were successful in these communities and suddenly families were able to emerge out into the streets and no longer live life under siege. Happy yes, but sick that they had to survive under these conditions for so long. For me I was relieved as well, but I knew I could buy my way out of there at some point while most didn't have that option.<br /><br />I'm willing to concede that this is a far more complicated issue than simply police procedures. I'm willing to concede that no one of these efforts can be granted full credit for a drop in crime, and that there are many other factors, though there is a lot of supporting evidence for a number of procedures. I'm absolutely not only willing to concede, but to speak out about the sickening way that in the name of fighting crime a number of procedures have  been abused in ways that are absolutely driven by racism, class-ism and a disregard for the dignity of human life.<br /><br />But in one way a glib answer is deserved in that I'm absolutely not willing to step back to the days,when people acted like there simply was no way to reduce crime in our most vulnerable areas, and the only way to fight it was to move away from it and &quot;those people.&quot; Choose whatever method you want, though an anodyne phrase like &quot;economic opportunity&quot;  may be great in the long term but doesn't help someone trying to make it through the day-today. I'm not going to give you an apology for thinking the police and how they are managed can and have to provide a major part of this solution.</div>

Maybe you're thinking of smitty? But you're right, it was glib and i had planned to expand on it. I spent the 80s and early nineties living in areas of cities, first Baltimore, then Jersey City, then New York, then Philadelphia, all of which  were mixed racially and all of which were experiencing high rates of crime. I saw efforts, or in some places didn't see efforts, to attack this pervasive atmosphere. Some of these involved the application of computerized surveys to previously completely antiquated methods of tracking crime, some of these involved enforcement of violations  of minor criminal offenses, some of these just involved good community policing. And while it may make you sick to read differing opinions on this board, it made me sick when efforts were successful in these communities and suddenly families were able to emerge out into the streets and no longer live life under siege. Happy yes, but sick that they had to survive under these conditions for so long. For me I was relieved as well, but I knew I could buy my way out of there at some point while most didn't have that option.<br /><br />I'm willing to concede that this is a far more complicated issue than simply police procedures. I'm willing to concede that no one of these efforts can be granted full credit for a drop in crime, and that there are many other factors, though there is a lot of supporting evidence for a number of procedures. I'm absolutely not only willing to concede, but to speak out about the sickening way that in the name of fighting crime a number of procedures have  been abused in ways that are absolutely driven by racism, class-ism and a disregard for the dignity of human life.<br /><br />But in one way a glib answer is deserved in that I'm absolutely not willing to step back to the days,when people acted like there simply was no way to reduce crime in our most vulnerable areas, and the only way to fight it was to move away from it and &quot;those people.&quot; Choose whatever method you want, though an anodyne phrase like &quot;economic opportunity&quot;  may be great in the long term but doesn't help someone trying to make it through the day-today. I'm not going to give you an apology for thinking the police and how they are managed can and have to provide a major part of this solution.</div></blockquote><br /><br />it's a nice response & I appreciate that, but it boils down to: stop and frisk is more or less good. Am I correct in reading that right?</div>
