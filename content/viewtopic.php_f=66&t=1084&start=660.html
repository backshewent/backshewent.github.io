(you're right, they aren't a think tank)<br /><br />Democracy Alliance funds CREW.<br /><br />Here's what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">WaPo</a> had to say about Democracy Alliance:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Democracy Alliance also has left some Washington political activists concerned about what they perceive as a distinctly liberal tilt to the group's funding decisions.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Here's how the organization determines who they fund:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wade declined to discuss the donors or the groups they fund. But, in an interview, she described how the groups were chosen. Alliance officials initially reviewed about 600 liberal and Democratic-leaning organizations. Then, about 40 of those groups were invited to apply for an endorsement -- with a requirement that they submit detailed business plans and internal financial information. Those groups were then screened by a panel of alliance staff members, donors and outside experts, including some with expertise in philanthropy rather than politics. So far, according to people familiar with the alliance, 25 groups have received its blessing.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />The Deputy Director of CREW <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php_display=rednews/2005/10/02/build/state/55-corrupt-label.inc" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">describes</a> the organization as:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>&quot;We are progressive,&quot; said Naomi Seligman, the group's deputy director and a former spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana. &quot;We do work within a larger progressive infrastructure.&quot;<br /><br />Seligman suggested her group is the progressive counterweight to Judicial Watch, a group from the right that calls itself &quot;a non-profit, public interest law firm dedicated to fighting government corruption.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />Here are some of their right wing projects:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>    * Clint Curtis<br />    * Swift Boat Veterans for Truth<br />    * Theft of Democratic documents within the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary<br />    * Ethics violations by Tom DeLay<br />    * Valerie Plame Wilson and Joseph C. Wilson v. I. Lewis Scooter Libby, Karl Rove and Richard B. Cheney.<br />    * Tax allegations against Leslee Unruh, who spearheaded the South Dakota abortion ban.<br />    * Former Representative Mark Foley (see Mark Foley scandal)<br />    * Curt Weldon, presently being investigated by the FBI<br /></div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm not saying any one of these guys is a good guy, misrepresented, honest, or anything.  I'm saying CREW presents an obvious left of center agenda in their work, and as such their evaluation has to be questioned when it comes to partisanship.  You'd expect the same when the Clairmont Institute publishes it's lists.
<br />
<br />My point is that it is <span style="font-style: italic">no surprise</span> that 84% of their bad guys are Republicans, and it shouldn't be to anyone who knows CREW's background.
<br />
<br />Partisans tell the truth all the time, the fact that they are partisan does not make them 100% liars or 100% truth tellers.  It makes their evaluations suspect to some degree no matter what.</div>

<br />
<br />I thought you liked to stay out of these threads... 
<br />
<br />As I understand them, CREW is a good-government group that tries to shine a spotlight on pay-to-play legislators and everyone who's overly comfortable with the notion that companies, or whoever, can buy one's vote. Though I'm not familiar with every individual on this list, I am aware of the ethical &quot;questions&quot; around all four senators (I think that's just how they roll in Alaska), as well as Reps. Doolittle, Hastings, Jefferson, Lewis, Mollohan, Murtha, Renzi and Young. 
<br />
<br />The report this is taken from is titled something like &quot;Beyond DeLay.&quot; One interpretation of this is what I gather is your view: they're picking on the Republicans. The other is that the distinguished Mr. DeLay was the guy who made it pretty much kosher for creeps like Doolittle, Lewis, Ney, Duke Cunningham and others to sell their votes without even doing much to conceal it. 
<br />
<br />In the first year of a new majority, there's been more of a focus on ethics and standards than there was toward the end of the Republican majority. (This was also true in 1995, when Gingrich was still fancying himself a reformer and the known sleazeballs were all Democrats--including John Murtha, who's presumably as happy back in the majority as a pig in... well, you know.) Given that Steny Hoyer is a big money guy, and Rahm Emanuel and Chuck Schumer are the sorts who will push the rules to their limits, I'm fairly sure that next year's list will have a bunch more Democrats, and the one in two years--when they've got 260 votes in the House, 58 in the Senate, and the corporate-contributions-craving Empress in the White House--could be as heavily tilted that way as this year's is toward your guys.</div>

			<div class="content">And, I might add, that's how it should be. When the Democrats go as proudly scummy as the Republicans did under DeLay, they should get eviscerated for it. 
<br />
<br />It's very possible that two years from now, &quot;partisans&quot; on the left and the right are going to be mad about the same things, or at least at the same people. The only difference could be that the liberals will be angry at their Democratic officeholders because they're unprincipled, and many of those on the right--not Vox, I shuold note--will hate them just because they've got the scarlet D after their names, indicating their hatred for God, country, guns and the Baby Jesus.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite><br />The report this is taken from is titled something like &quot;Beyond DeLay.&quot; One interpretation of this is what I gather is your view: they're picking on the Republicans. </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Well, screw Republicans.  They blew the trust of the people who elected them, blew the majority, blew the respect, and severely damaged the concept of conservatism.  I've voted Republican because their views are more closely associated with my own - but I don't want criminals and I certainly don't want people that can't convey a clear message or whose actions sully others who &quot;share&quot; their political position with their criminal behavior.  Lock em all up.  However, I find it extraordinarily hard to believe that it was so easy to find 20 Republicans yet they could only scratch together 4 token Democrats.  <span style="font-style: italic">Specifically because</span> of CREW's admitted and what I consider a fairly obvious and documented agenda that is not non-partisan by any stretch.  
<br />
<br />I don't even question their facts - I question what filter and criteria they chose to put them through.  Something tells me there are some items that a conservative wouldn't add or wouldn't leave off of that filter, and some value judgments that are debatable from a non &quot;progressive&quot; perspective.  I'm certain their research reveals some serious no doubt about it scumbagitude.  Which goes back to my comment that being partisan does not make one a liar.  We've discussed this before, I <span style="font-style: italic">prefer</span> partisanship on the whole.  However, with that said, I also suspect their research reveals some &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">if you agree with their progressive views</span>&quot; scumbagitude as well.  
<br />
<br />Whatever, I'm repeating myself. Being partisan doesn't mean they aren't telling the truth - I just think knowing CREW's motivations takes... oh, I don't know... 80% of the shock off of that list (going back to my original comment).
<br />
<br />AND, I hate when my itchy posting finger gets me into these discussions because I do hate this back-patting thread and I hate myself for even reading it (I normally avoid it completely).  I should unabashedly persecute each and every one of you.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>Who is defending them?  Did you look into CREW or just decide they aren't left wing just because?  (you're right, they aren't a think tank)</div></blockquote><br /><br />You were certainly defending them through your dismissive and sarcastic remark about them being called evil.  And you apparantly dismissed CREW's findings without knowing anything about them (unless I am reading your comment incorrectly).  So you mocked the validity of the list they were on which is a way of arguing that they may not really be as corrupt as they are being labled.  That is a defense, although based on an ad homenim attack on the group putting the list together rather than a direct defense of the individuals.  <br /><br />I didn't need to look into CREW because I already know a lot about them, including the investigations they have had ongoing for years about the members of that list.  I have heard countless interviews with Melanie Sloan about the ongoing investigations she has going.  I heard her discuss investigations into plenty of politicians who are now in jail.   <br /><br />I don't consider them left wing because I don't see anything ideological in what they do.  They investigate and expose corruption.  There is nothing left wing or right wing about corruption.  I consider myself progressive and I want them to expose whatever corruption there is among those who call themselves progressive as well as the corruption among those who call themselves conservatives.  I think that Judicial Watch has done some great investigations.  I know they are funded through conservative groups but I don't really consider what they do ideological.  Their efforts at being watchdogs sometimes makes them investigate Republicans including the Bush White House.  Just like CREW goes after Jack Murtha.  How does going after Jack Murtha help progressive causes?  Certainly a lot of progressives didn't think it was so great because they attacked CREW when they criticized Pelosi for backing him as majority leader.  <br /><br />My point of view is that corruption is an impediment to the democratic process, whether you are progressive or conservative.  Progressives should be interested in exposing corruption regardless of the ideology of the politician.  I don't really care what William Jefferson's political leanings are if he has $90,000 in his freezer.  I assume that he is more interested in pursuing the interests of those who gave him the money than the people who voted for him.  <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>I'm not saying any one of these guys is a good guy, misrepresented, honest, or anything.  I'm saying CREW presents an obvious left of center agenda in their work, and as such their evaluation has to be questioned when it comes to partisanship.  You'd expect the same when the Clairmont Institute publishes it's lists.<br /><br />My point is that it is <span style="font-style: italic">no surprise</span> that 84% of their bad guys are Republicans, and it shouldn't be to anyone who knows CREW's background.<br /><br />Partisans tell the truth all the time, the fact that they are partisan does not make them 100% liars or 100% truth tellers.  It makes their evaluations suspect to some degree no matter what.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The problem I had with your comment wasn't that you questioned the members on the list.  It was the opposite.  You dismissed the list without really questioning it.  Certainly their allegations could be bogus or the list could be unbalanced because they were leaving off members of one party who did things that got members of another party on the list.   Did you find any allegations to this effect in your reserach?  That seems like a more important question than the funding source of the organization that has been investigating these politicians.  Is it out of the question that the most corrupt politicians are mainly Republicans?</div>

<br />
<br />This is the exact reasoning use to denegrate Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.
<br />
<br />Reminds me when I was listening to G Cobb on the radio at the end of the last Eagles season and he was talking about how people were rallying around Garcia and were hating on McNabb.  He said it was a race issue.  Callers were then calling in saying that he was saying it was a race issue because he was black.
<br />
<br />This hits on a few latin fallacies.  Just because you are on one side, doesn't mean you aren't 100% accurate.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>phdave wrote:</cite>.....</div></blockquote><br /><br />I started to reply to all of this, then I got tired of pointing out how often you <span style="font-style: italic">decided</span> what I was thinking or what I <span style="font-style: italic">really meant</span> despite what  <span style="font-style: italic">actually wrote</span> and realized that continuing to debate such nonsense was pissing up a rope and I'm too smart to do that twice in one day.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I read over my post and I don't even see where I wrote anything about what you were <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> thinking or what you <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> meant.  <br /><br />I addressed your post:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>In other news, left wing think tank thinks Republicans are evil.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This post was dismissive (not questioning), sarcastic, and defended the Republicans on the list (at least indirectly).  I did remark that you made this comment without even knowing who CREW was, but I admitted that I got that from your post and maybe I was wrong.  I asked you a couple of questions (legitimate questions, not rhetorical).  The rest of my post was explaining my point of view.  <br /><br />So I have no idea what you are talking about by saying that I decided what you really meant.  You wrote a lot of stuff in your second and third posts that involved a lot more thought.  I don't think the comment above involved a lot of thinking to interpret.  <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>However, <span style="font-weight: bold">I find it extraordinarily hard to believe </span>that it was so easy to find 20 Republicans yet they could only scratch together 4 token Democrats. Specifically because of CREW's admitted and what I consider a fairly obvious and documented agenda that is not non-partisan by any stretch. <br /><br />I don't even question their facts - I question what filter and criteria they chose to put them through. <span style="font-weight: bold">Something tells me </span>there are some items that a conservative wouldn't add or wouldn't leave off of that filter, and some value judgments that are debatable from a non &quot;progressive&quot; perspective. I'm certain their research reveals some serious no doubt about it scumbagitude. Which goes back to my comment that being partisan does not make one a liar. We've discussed this before, I prefer partisanship on the whole. However, with that said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I also suspect their research reveals </span>some &quot;if you agree with their progressive views&quot; scumbagitude as well. </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />You are probably not reading this anymore, but I'd like to point out that their list isn't just a list.  They have been investigating these individuals and in many cases uncovering evidence of corruption.  They often work with the FBI on investigations.  Maybe you would find it interesting to learn more about the corruption they have uncovered. There is no need to speculate about why they put these people on the list, they put out a lot of information they collect on these individuals.  
<br />
<br />And I'll ask once again, are there Democrats they have not investigated who should have been investigated?  I really want to know.  You looked into it, maybe you found somethign.  If CREW is putting their thumb on the scale towards Republicans, that would bother me.  However, I've done a fair amount of looking into what they do and I don't see any bias in their methods.  
<br />
<br />I am sure there are many Democrats in office who wish CREW did not exist.  The Democratic leadership has done a few good things to emphasize ethics but they have not gone anywhere near as far as I would like them to go.  I think the reason is that they don't want to do too much because they worry about being targeted for ethics violations.  So I think that many Democrats are just as wary about CREW as many Republicans. 
<br />
<br />But the Republicans had been in charge for so long and their leadership (Delay) was very cavaleer about his own lack of concern for ethics that there was the perfect atmosphere for a majority of Republicans to be targets of ethic violations.  The violations they are being investigated for mainly happend years ago.  If the Democratic leadership is allowing similar ethics violations, it probably won't surface for some time.  If it does, I hope CREW continues to expose and investigate no matter which party is at fault.</div>

<br />I do think they fall short of that mark.

<br />
<br />Is there any evidence of a <span style="font-style: italic">filter</span>.  Evidence that members of this organization have been involved with causes that are considered left wing is not the same thing.  If they conduct their investigations with a left-wing filter, that would suggest that they take investigations of corruption by politicians more seriously if they are right-wing and less seriously if they are left-wing.  In order for me to be convinced of this, more republicans than democrats being investigated is not good enough.  More Republicans doing corrupt things is a reasonable contrary explanation.  Given the power position that Republicans have been in and the evidence that someone like Jack Abramoff was working exclusivly with Republicans, this is a reasonable possibiliy. 
<br />
<br />However, reasonable possibilities are not evidence.  I need to see cases of Democrats/left-wingers who are being treated better by CREW than Republicans who have done the same thing.</div>
