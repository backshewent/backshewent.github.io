			<div class="content"><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2015/09/we-need-to-be-able-to-call-out-kim-davis-bigotry-without-slut-shaming-or-hillbilly-shaming.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Interesting take</a> on people's reactions to Kim Davis.  I agree with the article's main thrust, certainly, although, and bear with me here, I'd hesitate to call Davis a &quot;bigot,&quot; for two interlocking reasons.  First, the word &quot;bigot&quot; suggests bias motivated by hatred, and I really doubt that what Davis is doing comes from hatred so much as it comes from certain ideological forces to which she has probably been exposed and with which she has agreed.  One obviously is her religion: and while many versions of Christianity (and many other perfectly valid religions) teach that homosexuality is a sin, Christianity, at least, most often recommends to its believers a policy of separating sin from sinner: love the sinner, hate the sin.  I may know someone is a thief, and that makes them a sinner, but it doesn't mean I &quot;hate&quot; them.  Much the same attitude might be brought to bear on this issue.  <br /><br />The other less obvious ideological influence, and this may be counter-intuitive, is libertarianism, or at least the streak of libertarian ideology that has been co-opted by certain populist elements of American conservative ideological construction (yes, I know she is a &quot;Democrat,&quot; but... come on).  To call this woman a &quot;bigot&quot; - and this is the second reason I reject this characterization of her behavior - is to locate the fault entirely within her and to pretend as though this entire incident has been about one woman's flawed character: in fact, her stance here is, in many ways, the logical reductio ad absurdum of the libertarian concept made plain.  While the committed libertarian will tell you theirs is an ideology about freedom so long as one does not hurt someone else or limit someone else - and therefore I expect many committed libertarians are indeed appalled by this woman's behavior - the problematic underlying concept underwriting all libertarian thought is visible in this woman's actions: the libertarian disdain for <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> limits to individual freedom of action except where <span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span> necessary has been transmogrified by the Right - and not unreasonably so - as a disdain for the will of society as it is expressed, as all societies have more or less always expressed such will, through the state.  <br /><br />The state, the way the libertarian narrative usuaally tells it, is at best an inconvenient truth, an annoying limit on the individual to be avoided where possible, and held at bay where it must be encountered.  But to a certain degree the state is identical with society, in that the state is, at least in theory in a democratic construction, the mode through which society expresses itself and its desires.  The libertarian streak present in American conservatism turns this scorn for &quot;the state&quot; up three or four notches extra, and the result is what we see here: she has somehow separated, in her mind, the &quot;state&quot; from &quot;society,&quot; so that she can legitimately, in her own mind, assert her individual right against encroachment by the state in her personal beliefs, and perform her job according to her personal beliefs without state interference... Even though her job is working for the state.  Her range for personal freedom of belief and action is not only sacrosanct, it is functionally infinite: it must be permitted to operate without restriction between the state and <span style="font-style: italic">itself</span>.  This is libertarian anti-state rhetoric brought to its logical vanishing point. <br /><br />But this forgets entirely that, in a republic at least, &quot;the state&quot; is not some arbitrary rule-making authority in existence only to curb &quot;our freedoms&quot; but instead society's own, elected and constituted method of expressing the common will.  Indeed, if one goes by the strict letter of libertarian thought - that one should have freedom of action unless and until one's freedom limits someone else's freedom - then the state should ALWAYS take precedence over the individual, because the state, as the vehicle of the people's will, is <span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span> the aggrieved party in any conflict between the two. If an individual wants to do something society has deemed undesirable, and has therefore elected representatives to enact laws to identify and punish this  undesirable behavior (a collection of practices we refer to as &quot;the state&quot;), then the individual must have his rights curbed because his/her freedom has encroached on everyone else's, by definition.<br /><br />I think the problem with libertarian thought is present in this contradiction - that it can simultaneously suggest an unlimited space for individual action, and the permanent primacy of the state.  In practice, in American conservative circles, libertarianism has come to mean little more than a bizarre kind of self-selected nationalism: I do what I want without regard to the state, and I choose at every opportunity to make the state, and thus society, identical with my particular set of beliefs.  This woman's actions have really exposed this fracture.  She has responsibility for her actions, yes, but her attitudes have been shaped by ideologies, and those ideologies deserve a lion's share of the blame for the chaos they have produced.<br /><br />I am exhausted while writing this, so forgive me if it makes no sense.</div>

I do however think there's some resentment involved (due to the SC ruling) and it caused her to deny licenses to same-sex couples so I think at least part of her motivation was a desire to stick to the gays. <br /><br />She's also slick because she started denying licenses to straight couples too when the media started snooping around in order to cover her ass.<br /><br />My gut tells me this isn't only about religious freedom and Kim Davis is using her position to impose her beliefs on others when her &quot;boss&quot; already told her that she can't do that.</div>

Motivation does not count for much if your actions are shitty, especially if your motivations are &quot;my personal beliefs are different&quot;, as it is in this instance.  <br /><br />The problem with your 2nd bit is that by &quot;hating&quot; homosexuality, that leads you to openly discriminate people who are homosexuals.  It's the same BS rationalization those damn bakers who refuse to bake gay wedding cakes.  They claim they aren't being hateful and they don't hate gay people all the while denying them services specifically because they're gay.  Motivations may matter in explaining someones actions, but actions are always the most important thing, moz, because actions have real world physical and emotional consequences.  Comparing homosexuality to a criminal act like theft is pretty crass, I must say.  Someone chooses to be a thief; people don't choose to be gay.<br /><br />Maybe it's just my personal belief that actions are much, much more consequential than what someone says or their motivations that leads me to be so adamant about hating this woman.  I just don't think you can explain away consistent shitty behavior with motivations, that's all.  You can apologize for your shitty behavior, grow as a person, and move on with your life(you know, like a grown ass adult?)</div>
