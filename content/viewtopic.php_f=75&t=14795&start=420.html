Sean and Steven Brooks faced a deportation proceeding scheduled at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, knowing that Steven Brooks, a gay Colombian man legally married to a U.S. citizen, could be sent back because the federally-sanctioned Defense of Marriage Act legally recognized only marriage between a man and a woman.<br /><br />A New York City immigration judge, Barbara Nelson, immediately adjourned Brooks’ deportation hearing after reading the Supreme Court ruling, specifically section 3 of DOMA which recognized only marriages between a man and a woman and granted federal benefits to such marriages. By striking down Section 3, the Supreme Court has allowed same-sex couples to receive more than 1,000 federal benefits and entitlements linked to marriage status.<br /><br />“We knew we wouldn’t have a decision until 10 a.m. and Steven’s case was at 10:30 a.m. so we had to get the decision to the court,” Lavi Soloway, the immigration lawyer representing the couple, told MSNBC. “Literally, when it was posted to the SCOTUS website, we printed it, and had our intern from our law firm run five blocks up Broadway and hand the 77-page court ruling to the judge at the immigration court.”<br /><br />After being married at City Hall shortly after the state of New York legalized same-sex marriage, Sean Brooks first filed a green card petition in 2011 for his husband Steven, who came to the United States in the 1990s when his family moved from Colombia. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied the green card petition because Sean’s marriage to his Colombian partner did not federally exist.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sean and Steven Brooks are one of 28,500 binational same-sex couples who no longer have to fear that DOMA will separate them. Nearly 11,500 same-sex couples exist in the U.S. in which neither partner is a citizen. With comprehensive immigration reform on thin ice in the halls of Congress, approximately 267,000 LGBT-identified individuals among the adult undocumented immigrant population eagerly anticipate federal recognition.</div></blockquote></div>

I'm just not sure it's going to work that way--and no one else does either. I believe Obama won the states where voter ID was in place by 2012. Our local NAACP chair thinks it's quite possible that voter ID will in fact motivate black people to vote at higher rates than they have in the past. And again, given that the real decline in turnout is in white voters, there's reason to suspect these efforts may backfire. <br /><br />At a conference, I asked someone who looked closely at Oklahoma how often people who lacked IDs really voted, given his findings that such people tend to be very socially disconnected. He said, obviously, they vote at very low rates, but no one really knows.</div></blockquote><br /><br />this is the <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2011/10/03/do-voter-identification-laws-depress-turnout-redux/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">monkeycage</a> answer and that's fine, but there were numerous examples of republican state legislatures trying to push through voter ID requirements that would make it more difficult for ALL people to vote, but especially younger and poorer people. i don't think you can deny that. <br /><br />but yeah, since there are no studies yet that prove anything 100%, let's come back to this in 2045 or whatever</div></blockquote><br /><br />Don't get me wrong--I oppose these efforts by Republican legislators. But I just don't think they'll have quite the impact that people think they'll have, and I've outlined some reasons why, and there's at least some reason to believe it will actually harm Republicans, who are already having a harder time attracting their &quot;not quite likely&quot; voters than Democrats. There's no reason not to believe that Republicans are still clinging to outdated turnout models that were so off in 2012 in &quot;crafting&quot; this legislation.</div>

She’s the daughter of as single woman, she was a teenage mother herself. She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas Senate. It’s just unfortunate that she hasn’t learned from her own example: that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential, and that every life matters.”<br /><br />Davis responded to the Houston Chronicle, saying Perry’s statement “is without dignity and tarnishes the high office he holds. They are small words that reflect a dark and negative point of view.”<br /><br />Davis started working when she was 14 to help her single mother and siblings; by 19 she was divorced with a daughter of her own. Living in a trailer park and “destined to live the life that I watched my mother live,” as she put it in a 2011 video, Davis was encouraged by a co-worker to go to community college. She worked two jobs and took paralegal classes, transferred to Texas Christian University, and after being the first in her family to get a bachelor’s degree went on to graduate from Harvard Law School with honors.</div></blockquote><br />the fuck, telling wendy davis how she doesnt know her own life's lessons</div>

James “Hoss” Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been notified that he’s under investigation for allegedly leaking information about a massive attack using a computer virus named Stuxnet on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Gen. Cartwright, 63, becomes the latest alleged leaker targeted by the Obama administration, which has already prosecuted or charged eight individuals under the Espionage Act.</span>Last year, the New York Times reported that Cartwright, a four-star general who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 2007 to 2011, conceived and ran the cyber operation, called Olympic Games, under President Bush. President Obama ordered the cyberattacks sped up, and in 2010 an attack using the Stuxnet worm temporarily disabled 1,000 centrifuges that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Times story included details of the Olympic Games operation, including the cooperation of Israeli intelligence. The story said that President Barack Obama had ordered the attacks, which began during the Bush administration, to continue even after Stuxnet “escaped” from the Natanz nuclear plant in Iran and began to spread via the Internet. The virus was first publicly identified by a computer security company in June 2010.<br />The story described meetings in the White House Situation Room and was based on 18 months of interviews with “current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program.” It credited Gen. Cartwright with presenting the original idea for Stuxnet to President Bush, said the NSA had developed the Stuxnet worm in tandem with the Israelis, and said thumb drives were first used to introduce the virus into the Natanz plant in 2008.</span>“This leak was very damaging,” said former California congresswoman Jane Harman, now a member of the Defense Policy Board. “Clearly what was going on here was a method and it should have been protected and I think it’s had devastating consequences.”<br />President Obama said in June 2012 that his attitude toward “these kinds of leaks” was “zero tolerance,” and that they were “criminal acts.”<br />According to legal sources, the original FBI probe into the Stuxnet leak focused on whether the information came from someone in the White House. By late last year, according to legal sources, FBI agents were zeroing in on Cartwright, who retired from the military in August 2011.<br />Cartwright did not respond to repeated requests for comment. His attorney, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, said only, “I have no comment.”<br />The White House declined to comment, as did Justice Department officials.<br /></div></blockquote></div>

But Weiner is an abomination. It's only a slight overstatement to say that he's the Michele Bachmann of the left; both seem to think that the purpose of politics is to make as much noise and get as little done as possible. Thompson is a consummate hack, but at least he's sort of a grown-up. Quinn, my preferred candidate, is sinking like a stone owing largely to the perception that she's utterly unprincipled as a politician. Sadly I can't really argue about that; I just think she happens to be competent and surrounds herself with good people. <br /><br />At this point I expect the general to feature Thompson vs. Joe Lhota, I expect to vote for Lhota (though I'm &quot;persuadable&quot; and it's entirely possible that the presence of Giuliani on the campaign trail will repulse me so much that I'll vote third party again, or even for Thompson), I expect Thompson to win, have a failed mayoralty and lose in the Democratic primary in four years. <br /><br />Bloomberg 4eva. It's been nice to have a mayor with no need to grovel for bucks, no partisan affiliation, no realistic ambitions to higher office, and an ego so large that he's utterly impervious to criticism in real time.</div>

(She said there was no deal yet.) The Republican senators rattled off a slew of conservative arguments against the law, stressing polls that signal its unpopularity with the public.<br /><br />The letter also suggests the Obama administration could be threatening the pro sports leagues to extract support for Obamacare:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">We have long been concerned by the Obama Administration’s record of using the threat of policy retaliation to solicit support for its policies or to silence its critics.

Instead, the documents say, officials were trying to use &quot;key word&quot; shortcuts to find overtly political organizations — both liberal and conservative — that were after tax favors by saying they were social welfare organizations.<br /><br />But the practice appeared to go much farther than that. One such &quot;be on the lookout&quot; list included medical marijuana groups, organizations that were promoting President Obama's health care law, and applications that dealt &quot;with disputed territories in the Middle East.&quot;</div></blockquote><br />so, it's not a political controversy, and never was. it's a process issue, one i'm not even sure is much of a problem since the exemption itself is crappy.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Groups involved more generally in carrying out the Affordable Care Act were also sent to the I.R.S. for “secondary screening.” <br /><br />And “occupied territory advocacy” seemed subject to the most scrutiny of all. <br /><br />“Applications may be inflammatory, advocate a one-sided point of view, and promotional materials may signify propaganda,” according to instructions with a lookout list. <br /><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The inspector general report that fueled the IRS tea party targeting scandal is &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; because it failed to include details that progressive groups were also flagged for extra attention, a senior House Democrat said late Monday.<br /><br />Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, is demanding answers from Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George about whether it investigated the use of search terms aimed at liberal organizations in the same manner as it probed the agency's oversight of groups that used terms such as &quot;tea party&quot; or &quot;patriot&quot; in their application for a tax exemption.<br /><br />&quot;The American public expects competent, impartial, unbiased, and non-political treatment from the IRS,&quot; Levin wrote. &quot;That same standard is also applicable to you and your organization. Your audit served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way.&quot;</div></blockquote><br />boy, i wonder how he forgot about those parts</div></blockquote><br />We'll see what comes out tomorrow at the hearing, but groups with progressive in the title were still granted exemptions while the tea party groups were not for huge stretches of time. It could be they were terms added to lists later or flagged but processed more quickly. Based on outcomes, it's clear there was a different process for some right leaning groups compared to others.</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that evidence so far shows only conservative groups underwent extra scrutiny cited by an inspector general's disclosure of the agency's targeting of applications for tax exempt status.<br /><br />An initial report on the IRS targeting scandal this week by Daniel Werfel, the IRS principal deputy commissioner, led to the disclosure that IRS workers flagged both liberal and conservative groups when assessing their eligibility for the tax break available to social welfare organizations.<br /><br />IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as &quot;tea party&quot; on &quot;Be on the Lookout&quot; or BOLO lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible, according to Werfel and the inspector general who first revealed the targeting.<br /><br />Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria including &quot;progressives,&quot; but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity faced by conservative groups, according to a letter to the panel this week by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George.<br /><br />Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/27/politics/irs-targeting/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">CNN</a><br /><br />Nothing to see here</div>

Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible.<br />Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said.<br />An IRS statement Monday said the &quot;safe-harbor&quot; option for self-certification would apply to groups that &quot;certify they devote 60% or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare.&quot;<br />&quot;At the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40% or less of both their spending and time,&quot; the statement said. Applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self-certification, it said.</div></blockquote><br />there appears to be no reason that qualifier was added. there also appears to be no reason to even have this exemption. honestly, the more orgs that get this exemption removed, the better. but, no one was destroyed because of the IRS.  sorry.</div>
