			<div class="content">34 Republicans voted against the rule on TPA, and 8 Dems had to vote for it to save the bill. Utterly pathetic. Vote against the bill on passage if you want but ffs support your party on the rule. These idiots are so dumb. Ranting against Obamatrade, what they're calling trade promotion authority in the Drudge/Breitbart portions of the internet, a power every president has had in some way or another for decades until now.</div>

			<div class="content">You're a part of a team, and sometimes you have to support it. You support the rule and let leadership put its bills on the floor, especially when it has the overwhelming support of your caucus. If you oppose the bill, oppose it on passage. These members get significant benefits in influencing legislation and sitting on important committees from being in the majority party. On votes regarding organization and rules, you support the party and don't act like some grandstanding twat trying to win plaudits from Mark Levin and Matt Drudge. In the not so distant past these people would be disciplined by ripping them off the committees they want to be on or threatening pulling funding in the reelect, but with the defanging of parties in BCRA and rise of third party groups that doesn't seem to work anymore. Makes it really difficult to pass anything remotely controversial.</div>

			<div class="content">Seantor Mark Kirk (R- IL) discussing Lindsey Graham's Southern Gentleman status:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>“I’ve been joking with Lindsey,” Kirk said, according to audio from the Huffington Post. “Did you see that? He’s going to have a rotating first lady. He’s a bro with no ho.”</div></blockquote><br /><br />Kirk on the efficacy of driving through various neighborhoods:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> want to make sure we have elected people constantly looking at helping the African-American community. With this state and all of its resources, we could sponsor a whole new class of potential innovators like George Washington Carver and eventually have a class of African-American billionaires. That would really adjust income differentials and make the diversity and outcome of the state much better so that the black community is not the one we drive faster through.</div></blockquote><br />i like the idea that having a few black billionaires would fix inequality.</div>

Immediately and predictably third party groups stepped into the void, though it started more on the left because the RNC with an incumbent president in the White House, was still piling up enough $25k checks that they didn't really need outside help yet. In 2004, America Coming Together backed by Soros, Peter Lewis, and the SEIU poured $80 mil into voter contact/registration/mobilization. I think the Democrats had an easier time with the idea of outside groups being hugely integrated into this side of campaigning because unions have always been important to GOTV for Dems. On our side, rich people write checks and the party is supposed to take care of it, but the big checks went to outside groups instead of to the party as might have happened previously. The outside groups that popped up stayed focused more on TV ads than voter registration/mobilization, leaving that to the party, which was fighting with one arm tied behind its back and increasingly doing a bad job at it compared to the Dems/Obama campaign/outside liberal groups. In 2012, it became abundantly clear that the party was miles behind the Dems on this stuff. The RNC has ramped up its own efforts on IDing voters and the other digital big data things, but the Kochs and their network of donors have also turned their attention to it. They think they can do a better job than the RNC, and they might not be wrong. It would be better for them to come to some sort of an accommodation where the tasks get split up rather than fighting with each other in public. It would be even better if we just let people give money to the parties, which are organizations which can be held democratically accountable by voters and serve a vital role in any functioning democracy, rather than shunting it off to less transparent corners with third party actors doing party tasks.</div>

			<div class="content">I think you guys are misunderstanding JH's position. Party discipline is a good thing--it helps do stuff. And note--you can make your vote on the rule, so stuff gets to the floor, and then vote against it, and thus register your opposition. <br /><br />If you don't like Koch Brothers and others driving policy, then you should support more, not less party strength. It's weak parties that allow interest groups to do their mischief. <br /><br />Here's the thing--you can advocate for systemic reforms of one kind or another, but that advocacy should never be based on who's ahead right now. If you like the fact that the Dems can keep stuff from reaching the floor with the filibuster today, but you didn't like it two years ago, then you're confused. <br /><br />Me, personally, I think the whole Senate is pointless, and would like to get rid of it, or have its status reduced to something like the House of Lords. Also, I dislike the electoral college, even though it currently does favor the Democrats.</div>

You support the rule and let leadership put its bills on the floor, especially when it has the overwhelming support of your caucus. If you oppose the bill, oppose it on passage.

On votes regarding organization and rules, you support the party and don't act like some grandstanding twat trying to win plaudits from Mark Levin and Matt Drudge. In the not so distant past these people would be disciplined by ripping them off the committees they want to be on or threatening pulling funding in the reelect, but with the defanging of parties in BCRA and rise of third party groups that doesn't seem to work anymore. Makes it really difficult to pass anything remotely controversial.</div></blockquote><br />I know this is all true, but I think it's all a gross way to run a democracy.  The &quot;team&quot; aspect of politics is what most people are frustrated with and why nothing ever gets done.  The fact that you continually post about politics in this manner is really disgusting to me and I'll continue to point it out.  I'm glad some republicans had the guts to stand up to their party on a cause they cared about and belittling them for it is dumb.</div>

Basically, any adoption agency can deny any couple or person for any reason they want as long as they cite religious reasons.  This includes, of course, gay people, but also divorcees,Jews, Muslims, Christians, whoever. Plus, there's another wrinkle they really didn't think of:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Republican state Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, told the Free Press that because faith-based agencies handle most of the children Michigan places with foster families or adoptive parents each year — pocketing more than half the $19.9 million that the state spent last year to support adoption and foster care services — lawmakers have little choice.<br /><br />&quot;If they close their doors,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't know what we'll do with all the children. This is a real threat.&quot;<br /><br />Jones is not absolutely wrong.<br /><br />The truth is that Michigan's approach to dealing with the 13,000 children in its care is at real risk of collapsing if the Supreme Court invalidates all state-sponsored discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Right now, about 50% of the state's adoption work is performed by religious agencies who, in the likely coming legal reality, won't be able to or won't want to receive taxpayer money because they discriminate.<br /><br />Faced with the loss of that kind of capacity, lawmakers and the governor should be panicked — and seeking some alternative way to ensure the state's 13,000 in-custody children continue to see adoption opportunities.<br /></div></blockquote><br />good job!</div>

The state Senate overrode the veto earlier this month.<br /><br />While gay marriage was targeted in a wave of conservative legislation in U.S. statehouses this year, North Carolina is among the few states to pass a measure.

And that is not so good on a couple of different levels. <br /><br />Given the laws in place, I would rather the party and the third party people come to an agreement of sorts where they can work in a similar direction or split up tasks so resources aren't wasted. This is not because a single voter would ever possibly give a fucking shit about who has the best voter database in Republican/conservative circles, but because fighting about it publicly and alienating each other rather than working toward a solution that helps the right catch up to the Democrats on this stuff is not going to accomplish anything good.</div>

			<div class="content">One of those afternoons when watching C-Span proves rewarding. TAA, the job retraining bit that often gets stuck onto trade deals, goes down after Pelosi and the Dems vote against it heavily when it's usually the side of trade bills Dems back and Republicans oppose. The bill, now different than the Senate bill, seemed momentarily dead. Then the House passed trade promotion authority anyway 219-211. It's not clear what happens next. Boehner is asking for a revote on TAA, I think. Since 219 are on the record in favor of TPA without the job retraining bit, which is usually included as a sweetener to attract Dem support for trade bills, I guess the idea is they might as well back it now with the threat that maybe the Senate takes up the House bill. Or that Republicans opposed to it but in favor of trade promotion should back it to get the whole package through. More time for Obama to work on his crew and another chance for Ryan et al. to work on the Republican caucus, I guess. The people on Twitter and C-Span both don't seem to know what's going on.</div>

If members of the House and Senate always voted along party lines(or roughly so), your basically only voting for 2 different opinions on ALL the issues.

			<div class="content">Imagine if there were 435 options on a multiple choice test, and in order to pass the law, a majority needs to select the same option. This is what would happen if everyone was acting independently in the House, and this is what jerseyhoya is describing. As a libertarian who believes that most of what Congress does is neutral or harmful, I don't have a huge problem with fewer bills being passed. But I, like most people, would prefer a situation where bills with large support can get passed and funded.<br /><br />It's kind of funny that jerseyhoya is lamenting that Congress can't get any bills passed, and he's getting pushback from liberals who were complaining last year that Congress was not getting bills passed.</div>
