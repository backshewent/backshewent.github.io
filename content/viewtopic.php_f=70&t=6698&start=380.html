			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>Interesting discussion. Maybe it centers on how quickly the best and brightest within the Republican Party realize that, right now, the Democrats are closer to the mainstream of American public opinion than they are, and that the Democrats' proposed solutions, imperfect though they might be, simply seem more relevant than the more-of-same that the Republicans are offering. <br /><br />That said, I'm a bit closer to jerseyhoya on this; I do think these things are cyclical. Go back fifty years and you see these same two factions within the Republican Party: the Eisenhower/Rockefeller types who more or less accepted the New Deal and decided they could thrive within its framework--especially if a willingness to do so meant the difference between winning and losing--and the Buckley/Goldwater types who wanted to burn that system down and to some real extent preferred to lose running on their principles than win compromising them. That viewpoint becomes less and less attractive as you spend more time out of power. </div></blockquote><br /><br />Fifty years ago there wasn't a social conservative faction that is very divisive. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>The thing is that, as much as people look at the 1968-2008 period as one of Republican ascendancy, the only candidate who ever ran even sort of explicitly on that Buckley/Goldwater worldview and won was Reagan--and he was a political genius running in a climate as favorable to him as the current moment is to Obama. Bush wasn't that guy in 2000, and the way he won in '04 was a unique result of that political moment. <br /><br />(The question is whether moderate Republicans can ever really rise again. I've written many times here that I think this only happens if and when they stop giving Norquist and Dobson an effective veto over their national leadership, and start embracing a worldview--and this is definitely in the Eisenhower/Rockefeller tradition--that allows for the possibility of government, even limited government, working as a positive force in the lives of average Americans. But maybe that's just me.) <br /><br />Perhaps what happens is that eventually, parties out of power come back to power by first pissing off their base, then convincing said base that what the true believers initially see as compromise or capitulation actually can be accommodated within the party's philosophy. With the arguable exception of free trade, there's no serious debate among Democrats anymore about most of the &quot;deviationist&quot; things Clinton pushed in the '90s. It just took both time and the miserable experience of being completely shut out at the federal level by Bush and DeLay to incorporate welfare reform, newfound regard for law enforcement, etc as part of the scenery. <br /><br />Probably one could make a case that this is what Douthat and his bunch are trying to do--but to my knowledge, they don't really have champions in office, the way the New Dems did at the state level and in Congress starting in the '80s. Maybe Pawlenty, coiner of the &quot;Sam's Club Republicans&quot; handle, is in that boat. </div></blockquote> <br /><br />No doubt, there are a number of interesting and talented conservative intellectuals (I count a number of them as friends) and bloggers. But they're not running for office and winning elections. The problem is that there's no one out there who can really sell those ideas--they don't seem to be developing the political talent that could implement these ideas, for reasons you indicated above. Again, Arkansas is instructive--we had Huckabee as governor for 10 years--mostly effective, even his critics found things to admire about him, but the Shi'ite Republicans (Huckabee's term for them) never recognized the opportunity he and his mentor Wynn Rockefeller were for Republicanism in this state. They were too busy counting Jim Bob Duggar's kids. <br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>Actually, it's ironic that Bill Clinton could prove to be the bridge from the old, intellectually exhausted and widely despised Democratic Party of the Reagan era to a new center-left Obama-era majority... keeping in mind that Obama and the Democrats have to deliver as a governing party, which is probably no better than a 50 percent shot. Otherwise, they'll default it back to the Republicans, and this moment will be no more lasting than '76 or '92.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Right--the problem the Democrats have going forward is they're going to have to deliver something in a very tough environment. Clinton really was fortunate in that he faced no real challenge he didn't create himself during his two terms. 
<br />
<br />To me, if Obama wins, he'll either be a transformational Roosevelt figure, or he'll be disaster of Carteresque proportions--it's unlikely that he'll be a middling.
<br />
<br />I also suspect that unless he wins a very convincing popular vote victory--say like 53/47 or larger, he's gonna have no real honeymoon.</div>

			<div class="content">So... Huckabee's a &quot;Sunni Republican&quot;? 
<br />
<br />But you make a great point. In that he's overtly religious AND an economic populist, he probably embodies the future of that party better than anyone else on the scene. That he's fairly young, has a good record in office, and is a great retail politician and a likable guy suggests that he has as good a shot as anybody to be the next Republican president.</div>

			<div class="content">Paul, I think part of our difference here is Arkansas is sort of an anomaly, but you're using it as your go to example. No Southern state is as staunchly Democratic as Arkansas, and no state outside the South has the same overwhelmingly Christian right electorate utterly dominating the nomination process.
<br />
<br />You mentioned New Jersey before, but our last four statewide GOP nominees have been moderates (Forrester 2x, Kean and Zimmer). Kean is the State Sen leader, and he's clearly a moderate. Lance was leader before him, and he's the perfect example of a fiscal conservative social moderate. Outside of Schundler, I don't think we've nominated a conservative for statewide office since 1989.</div>

<br />He should be a laughing stock, not a serious candidate.

<br />I like the guy(or who he pretends to be) but jesus christ. 
<br />
<br />The ten commandments have ZERO to do with American law.  A grand total of TWO of them are applicable. Its just a fricken joke.

<br />
<br />Arkansas is an anomaly, for lots of reasons. Republican party was not characterized by Dixiecrats switching parties for one. 
<br />
<br />But the reason I point to Arkansas is that the fact that the Republicans aren't even trying here says something about the party. Yes, much of it is particular to this state. But the fact that Huckabee is more or less a moderate, even if you take social into account, shows that there is a substantial wingnut element out there.</div>

<br />The Democrats are winning right now not because of proposed solutions but because of the concept &quot;we're not Republicans.&quot; The basics from Obama are &quot;hope (because the Republicans don't give us any), change (from the incompetent Republicans), and McCain is four more years of Bush.&quot; Republicans have run on concepts for years, while the Democrats have nominated smart guys who explained their solutions in long winded fashion.

<br />
<br />i agree its stupid.  and it is put out by the campaign.  but it is edited and framed in a way that almost makes it seem independent, like one of those robert greenwald films.  
<br />
<br />even if much of it is true.  and maybe it is <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/06/fact-check-did-mccain-intervene-on-behalf-of-charles-keating/">http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/20 ... s-keating/</a><!-- m --> it risks letting mccain help get the discussion off track.
<br />
<br />either way... the dems better not mess this one up.  as nate silver wrote in his blog today.  it looks like mccain is facing a 3rd and long and is about to get sacked.  but of course, there is that 4th down hail mary to survive, i wonder what that will be.  &quot;barack obama eats children?&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">For those who haven't seen the CNN piece on Bill Ayers and his relationship with Obama...
<br />
<br />[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4EoEkI_sSs[/youtube]
<br />
<br />It's obvious Ayers played a significant role in Obama's rise through the Chicago political machine since the mid-1990's.  
<br />
<br />Does this mean Obama is a terrorist sympathizer?  I don't think so at all.
<br />
<br />What it does call into question is Obama's judgement and character to surround himself with the likes of Ayers, Wright et al. when it was political expedient to do so (and then throw them overboard when they became a liability).
<br />
<br />With McCain and Keating, McCain owned up to his lapse in judgement a long time ago.  Some blame McCain-Feingold on McCain's &quot;regret&quot; over his connection to Keating (even though his connection was found to be overstated to a large degree).  Also, the Keating Five affair was thoroughly covered by the press and only now is Obama's connection to Bill Ayers getting some serious scrutiny.</div>
