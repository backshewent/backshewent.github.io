Hilarious indeed.</div></blockquote><br /><br />wow, did you ever misread that. <br /><br />It's plain his contention is that people seem perversely to grouse only when the 'excessive' spending benefits people like themselves, & not when it coddles plutocrats & their interests.<br /><br />once again your expensive 'prestige' education has let you down.</div></blockquote>
<br />His contention, which you summarized accurately, is easily explained by my sarcastic post, that the amounts wasted are what drives anger.  It's not the recipients of $50M in wasted funds that's going to inspire 200,000 people to gather, no matter how wasteful the giveaway.  How many people gathered in protest for the AIG bonuses?  Only a few dozen.  And people were ANGRY about them.  It's when $1T of questionable value is spent that causes action.  I thought my post was clear, but next time I'll explain the reasoning behind my sarcasm, so you won't have to make the logical leap yourself.

<br />
<br />Really, you don't have a problem when someone passes judgment on an entire class of people?  Reread what I bolded.  His point would still stand, that the level of political discourse is relatively low, without the rhetorical flourish that he uses (Stressing &quot;every single one&quot; instead of just saying &quot;most&quot;).  It is people like him, that dismiss entire waves of people, that results in the very tone of politics that he decries.  People on both sides spend too much time constructing ad hominems and the like, as opposed to answering any legitimate claims that the other side has.</div>

<br />Your previous post was clear - it showed you did not get the material you quoted. This post seems to elaborate on your misapprehension.

			<div class="content">There is an <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,517074,00.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">important case</a>coming up on the Supreme Court's docket.  
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This week, the Supreme Court will consider the reverse discrimination claim of Marcarelli and a group of white firefighters. They all passed a promotion exam, but the city threw out the test because no blacks would have been promoted, saying the exam had a &quot;disparate impact&quot; on minorities likely to violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<br /><br />Besides affecting how race can be considered in filling government and perhaps even private jobs, the dispute also addresses broader questions about racial progress: Do minorities and women still need legal protection from discrimination, or do the monumental civil rights laws that created a more equal nation now cause more harm than good?<br />...<br />One hundred and eighteen people took the tests; 56 passed. Nineteen of the top scorers were eligible for promotion to 15 open lieutenant and captain positions. Based on the test results, the city said that no minorities would have been eligible for lieutenant, and two Hispanics would have been eligible for captain. (The lawsuit was filed by 20 white plaintiffs, including one man who is both white and Hispanic.)<br /><br />The exams were designed by a professional testing firm that followed federal guidelines for mitigating disparate racial outcomes, the plaintiffs say.</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Torre [The plaintiff's lawyer] argues that discarding a test because no minorities would have been promoted violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination because of race.<br /><br />Call it a legal riddle only the Supreme Court could solve: The white firefighters say Title VII prohibits discrimination against them for being white; New Haven says Title VII prohibits it from using a test that has a disparate impact against blacks.</div></blockquote></div>

<br />I think a well designed test would be very important as people move up the line from actively fighting fires to planning for and supervising the fighting of fires and to being the public face of the city at the scene of the fire.  The best firefighter in the world could be an awful fire captain.</div>

<br />
<br />Well, sure, I understand the point of exams is to remove favoritism and bias from hiring decisions, and some kind of objective standard is important when we're talking about the public sector. It does seem that certification in software might have more to do with being able to actually do the work than a test would have to do with being a good leader in a fire department. I mean, with study, I could I bet ace the fire fighter exam. But if there's an actual fire, I'm pretty sure I'll run and panic and really screw it up pretty badly. 
<br />
<br />I actually now think it might be germane to the issue at stake though. If the city can show that the exam does not do a good job of indicating who would do well in the position, then throwing out the results (especially since the exams were implemented in the first place to eliminate bias) might be defensible. It does seem though that issue would be handled at a lower court level.</div>

<br />
<br />As a workforce development person I agree with this. It's a bit of a simplification, but on the whole, quantifying skills=good. 
<br />
<br />OTOH, the point that as one goes up the ladder, the relevant skills become harder to quantify (even when one puts aside cronyism considerations) makes sense too.</div>

<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rep. Jane Harman , the California Democrat with a longtime involvement in intelligence issues, was overheard on an NSA wiretap telling a suspected Israeli agent that she would lobby the Justice Department to reduce espionage-related charges against two officials of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, the most powerful pro-Israel organization in Washington.<br /><br />Harman was recorded saying she would “waddle into” the AIPAC case “if you think it’ll make a difference,” according to two former senior national security officials familiar with the NSA transcript.<br /><br />In exchange for Harman’s help, the sources said, the suspected Israeli agent pledged to help lobby Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., then-House minority leader, to appoint Harman chair of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections, which the Democrats were heavily favored to win.<br /><br />Seemingly wary of what she had just agreed to, according to an official who read the NSA transcript, Harman hung up after saying, “This conversation doesn’t exist.”<br /><br />Harman declined to discuss the wiretap allegations, instead issuing an angry denial through a spokesman.</div></blockquote>

<br />Well, this isn't at the root of the lawsuit, and from the article, it doesn't appear that this defense was brought forth.  The problem with using this defense is that there is no evidence, or reason to suggest, that the test does a poor job of identifying worthy firefighters for promotion.  The only &quot;evidence&quot; of unsuitability is the resulting racial distribution.  When you think about the great pains that were went through to pay for and design this test, I can understand the predicament they've put themselves in.  They're essentially trying to throw out the results, but they did everything they could have to make the test as objective as possible.</div>

To try and break up the whole &quot;boss/favoritism&quot; mentality when offering work or identifying who is or isn't qualified.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, sure, I understand the point of exams is to remove favoritism and bias from hiring decisions, and some kind of objective standard is important when we're talking about the public sector. It does seem that certification in software might have more to do with being able to actually do the work than a test would have to do with being a good leader in a fire department. I mean, with study, I could I bet ace the fire fighter exam. But if there's an actual fire, I'm pretty sure I'll run and panic and really screw it up pretty badly. <br /><br />I actually now think it might be germane to the issue at stake though. <span style="font-weight: bold">If the city can show that the exam does not do a good job of indicating who would do well in the position, then throwing out the results (especially since the exams were implemented in the first place to eliminate bias) might be defensible.</span> It does seem though that issue would be handled at a lower court level.</div></blockquote><br />Well, this isn't at the root of the lawsuit, and from the article, it doesn't appear that this defense was brought forth.  The problem with using this defense is that there is no evidence, or reason to suggest, that the test does a poor job of identifying worthy firefighters for promotion.  The only &quot;evidence&quot; of unsuitability is the resulting racial distribution.  When you think about the great pains that were went through to pay for and design this test, I can understand the predicament they've put themselves in.  They're essentially trying to throw out the results, but they did everything they could have to make the test as objective as possible.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />With all due respect, the article pretty much sucked, at least as a piece of legal reporting. It's not really an affirmative action case. Even worse, the article fails to provide case identification information. For instance, it's relevant that lower courts have sided in narrow decisions with the city of New Haven. The obvious challenge to the idea that the test is flawed is then why did the city use the test in the first place. 
<br />
<br />But the main issue is to reconcile two conflicting elements of title VII.</div>

<br />
<br />I guess it depends on what the organizational goal is: excellence in fidelity to an articulated (if probably subsequently ignored) mission, or status-quo self-perpetuation. I'm not so naive about city bureaucracies to assume that it's the former the majority of the time, but it's probably not good to let the cynicism become so pervasive that even the possibility is laughed away.</div>
