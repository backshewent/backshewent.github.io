			<div class="content">I should add that another thing I find disturbing about so much backing of Israel is where it comes from (in this country). it's not some altruistic thing about justice and morality, but rather it comes from this crazy notion of Israel needing to exist for hte end times to come and for people to be 'saved'.  You can't talk nuance when part of the people you're talking to believe that.</div>

They could not villify Abbas for even considering dropping the right of return as a pre-condition to negotiations and understand that difficult and in many cases painful compromises by both sides will be necessary to bring about a resolution.<br /><br />But I do want to make clear that I truly believe both sides are to blame.  I cannot stand the Israeli extremists who continue to build and live in settlements on land that everyone knows will ultimately be a part of an independent Palestinian state.  All those people do is enflame tenions and metaphorically spit in the eye of the Palestinians.  The majority of Israeli support dismantling all of these settlements and the government should listen to them.</div>

That's because most of these settlers are ultra-orthodox Jews who believe Israel must return to biblical borders (i.e., including most of Jordan) and that population also has the highest birth rates (for obvious reasons).  I can't stand religious extremists in the US and I can't stand them in Israel or Palestine or anywhere.</div>

			<div class="content">I've probably talked about the Iron Law of Emulation here before. That's more or less the problem in Israel. As the Israeli group that most resembles the ignorant and hateful fanaticism of the militants among the Palestinians--the super-Orthodox settlers--acquires more and more political power, the moderates are marginalized. That Netanyahu sees himself as a Churchill forever looking for his Hitler to heroically oppose doesn't help either. <br /><br />There also has to be a factor of psychological exhaustion on the part of the Israeli center and left. They were so close to a solution at a couple points, getting even Sharon to come around, and it just didn't happen. So now the best lack all conviction.</div>

We're talking about rockets fired indiscriminately into towns and villages - not dumping some trash on your neighbor's lawn.  <br /><br />But I understand where Pac is coming from and I know (at least to the extent you can know someone on a message board) that he cares deeply for helping those in poor socio-economic conditions, here and abroad.

I'm not sure that's entirely correct. I guess on a collective level, Americans would like a very large and stable middle class. But as individuals, I think lots of people want more than that. Or maybe it's just Lil' Vulture who wants a horse farm in the country, among other things usually associated with substantial wealth.</div></blockquote><br /><br />When you're (&quot;you&quot;  meaning Jindal) scrambling to tamp down your cranky drunk impotent uncle's haranguing, you can get important details wrong.<br /><br />Surprised there's no conspiracy theory to the effect that the stupid remarks are just Mitt's way of intentionally pooping in the Republican party pool in retribution for its tepid support for his candidacy<br /><br />I mean another perfectly reasonable explanation is that his whining stupidity is of a piece with his utter lack of political talents, but people more expert than me continue to assure me that the guy has natural political gifts. I have not EVER seen evidence of ANY such talents, but I'm just a voter so what do I know.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Are you talking about Romney's political gifts? Because I don't know of anyone who really thinks he's a gifted politician, regardless of ideology. <br /><br />He doesn't even fit the genteel aristocrat model of say a Kennedy or a Roosevelt. I think being born privileged is a pretty big liability in politics, and it takes a huge amount of charisma to overcome it. Privileged Kennedy was barely able to beat Nixon. Privilege Bush I was able to beat Dukakis (who I think grew up in upper-middle class comfort--dad was a doctor) and Gore and Bush were similar in their family backgrounds. But unless I'm mistaken, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama all grew in more modest circumstances than their opponent. Carter grew up in better circumstances than Ford, so that was something of an exception.</div>

My 99% percent comment is more a statement of what is possible and not what is currently reality.  I was saying that if there was peace, education and upbringing on each side changed to not demonize the other, eventually this would be the situation.  Then you would be left with just the marginalized extremists that you have in every country (Timothy McVeigh, those who think we are being invaded by Mexico, Republicans (just kidding), etc.).  <br /><br />I also understand Palestinian's support of Hamas even though it is clearly counter-productive in the long run.  Hamas is who provides your basic needs, provides the schools and therefore dictates the education the next generation receives.  That is why I have advocated for the US to use its financial muscle to change Palestinian perception that Hamas helps them rather than hurts them.  <br /><br />If I were Obama, I would set a certain amount of foreign aid to Israel and to the Palestinians.  If Hamas destroys an Israeli home with a rocket, it is rebuilt and the cost comes out of the Palestinians aid from the US.  If a bomber destroys a restaurant, it is rebuilt and compensation to the victims comes out of Palestinian aid money.  If Israel blows up a building in the West Bank, same deal.  Any collateral damage, Israel pays out of their money and compensates the victims.  If a Palestinian could see that every rocket fired by Hamas only costs them money and aid, perhaps they would be more inclined to stop it (same applying for Israelis voting against provocation).</div>

			<div class="content">Support for Hamas has as much to do with the corruption and incompetence of Fatah as it has to do with Hamas's radicalism. To ignore the domestic realities and consider only the foreign appeal is a mistake. It's also the case that in the early 90s, it was largely Fatah (at the time seen by many, if not most Palestinians as illegitimate) that failed to take advantage of the best opportunity for peace for several generations. <br /><br />Groups like Hamas can be transformed in real political parties and political partners--a reasonable example might be Sinn Fein. There are also similarities with the ANC. <br /><br />The South African experience is instructive. First, most people believe that the ultimate outcome would be a horrific civil war. That didn't happen, largely because Mandala and DeKlerk understood what they had to do with their domestic constituencies in order to reach a peaceful settlement. Ian Shapiro is a political scientist who has done some outstanding work on comparing these three situations.</div>
