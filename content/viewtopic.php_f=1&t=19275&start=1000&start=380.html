Think of the risk you are putting on the Phillies in ADDITION to the money you are making.  If he opts out, we had 3 great years, good, but we then lose after that.

Arenado just got one. It's the cost of doing business with the elite free agents. Boras and Harper are almost certainly going to want all of the perks ($300M+, third-year opt-out, at least $32.5M and likely $35M AAV) that others have gotten. It's exactly why Boras has dragged this out so long. He wanted the market set so he could top it.</div>

Boras is putting all of the risk on the Phillies and making no commitment to the organization in return. Additionally, if the Phillies were to publicly back out and pull their offer, the market for Harper collapses.  Boras could point to the Arenado contract as being the market value but it is only if another club would be willing to pay it.  Without the Phillies in the hunt, there is no market.  So like it or not the Boras camp and the Phillies are in a symbiotic relationship.</div>

If he stinks, we are stuck with 7 more years of him.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Scenario A: Three good years and he stays<br />Scenario B: Three good years, but he decides to bail on us (or jack his price up)<br />Scenario C: Doesn't play well<br /><br />Scenario B isn't that bad. Obviously it would sting if we don't have October success and he leaves. But that will be very dependent on how the rest of the team performs, if our farm system improves so we can make trades again, what other FAs maybe come on board in the meantime. Basically, if we have good years, we're happy and set for the future. If not, who cares if he leaves, we need to rebuild anyway.<br /><br />Scenario C sucks, but that's the case whether he stays or goes at the end. Sounds like we're offering 10 years, so if he wants to use them all, he can do so no matter when the opt-out takes effect.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>D2S wrote:</cite>The 3 year opt out of a 10 year contract is insane.  Think of the risk you are putting on the Phillies in ADDITION to the money you are making.  If he opts out, we had 3 great years, good, but we then lose after that.  If he stinks, we are stuck with 7 more years of him.  He wants to hedge 7 more years cause he could not be close to worth the contract.  What we would want is for him to opt out cause it means he was worth it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yeah, the 3 year opt-out sucks. The &quot;opt-outs&quot; are just opportunities for the player to re-negotiate their contract with their team. If they do well, their team has little choice but to re-sign them for more money/years (see Kershaw). If they suck, they just keep getting paid. The only times players will likely walk away is if they are somewhere in-between. His first 3 years are likely to be his best. This is not the time we want to be forced to re-negotiate with him.<br /><br />Im of the belief that we've had the best deal on the table ever since Manny signed and nothing has changed. I hope we dont budge another inch on anything (salary or opt-out years). This stand-off can continue for as long as it takes. We're his best option.</div>

			<div class="content">A couple idle thoughts:<br /><br />1. When your rebuilding plan is to limit pay roll for several years to plan for a free agency period years away and have teams that suck, you run the risk of your standing among your peers going into heavy decline. It's what makes these kinds of plans so risky. Not only do you have to outbid teams in a sport with no salary cap, but you have to convince them to commit to you for many years. Not as easy to do when you just came off several years of no playoffs, and many of them a bottom 3 team the league. Which puts you in a position to have to overpay and beat everyone else. Not saying this was a faulty plan, I still think we get him, I'm just saying it's incredibly risky putting all your eggs in one basket.<br /><br />2. We wouldn't be nearly as stressed if we had a superstar bat in the minors waiting in the wings. We haven't developed a superstar bat since Utley and Howard. Hoskins is looking like he can become that, so hoping he's the trend breaker that continues on. But I am tired of seeing some clubs crank out these star minor league bats every few years and we can barely get one every decade.</div>

There's a huge difference between &quot;not my first choice&quot; and &quot;I actively don't want to live/play there.&quot;  If he really doesn't want to play here, I just don't think he's going to sign here, plain and simple. If he gets the record contract he wants, it's not like that deal is going to be super-tradeable, so he's going to be stuck there until at least his opt-out, whenever that is.</div>

Instead of going through all those theatrics and potentially sabotage your chances just for whatever self-fulfilling reasons, you can just simply act like an adult and say &quot;our best offer's on the table, we're not moving off the key points of the deal, if you find a better offer, best of luck in your future, but if not, we'll be right here waiting with contract in hand.&quot;<br /><br />It's not like they're going to move on to the next superstar outfielder. It's Harper or Nick Williams at this point. If Harper signs, great. But there's no real impetus to make him decide RIGHT NOW except for our sanity, which I will gladly forfeit to increase my chances.</div>
