			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Luzinski's Gut wrote:</cite>Here's how I think this played out. <br /><br />Boras told LA and SF at the start that Harper only wants to play for them. He says we can leverage Philly because they have an owner who can't keep his mouth shut about spending money, so let them set the market, and once I get a firm offer from them, I'll come back to you and we can start the serious negotiations. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Boras uses the whores in the baseball press like a fiddle, giving out small indications of info without giving away the real game, which is how to maximize SF and LA. So he uses the White Sox and Nats at first, they fall out, he lets the Phils squirm for a while, then I think he gets the ultimatum from Middleton last week. <br /><br />That's when he makes the SF and LA news public, sure the Phils can see themselves as a contender, but Boras has already achieved what he wanted - to ensure his client plays where he wants, cranked up the AAV and over all price to set the market between SF and LA. He can always go back to Philly because they have a GM who a quant and blabbed about overvaluation with Machado and an owner who is going to lose significant credibility with his fan base...they can be counted on to do what needs to be done, useful idiots as Lenin said.<br /><br />We aren't getting Harper and we never were. This was the long scam between Boras, Harper, and the two West Coast teams. <br /><br />It's under 1% he's coming here. And it's always been that way. <br /><br />For Middleton and Klentak to set up this scenario as the primary and secondary courses of action is mind blowingly stupid. Sure, they've added some real nice pieces, but they aren't going to the playoffs this year minus a small miracle. The real question is - does the Boras model get adopted by the rest of the league with the Phillies and free agents? I'd give it about 24-36 months to determine the impact on future free agents and their desire to play in Philly.<br /><br /><br />The Phils are already fighting against the glamour teams of SoCal, the glitz of NYC, the weird Boston fetish that somehow has emerged over the last two decades, and even the Texan big market/no state income tax teams. <br /><br /><br />The Phils better find another way to sell the team, the city, the area, because we might be seeing a slow semi-permanent fossilization as the best second tier team in the country (along with the Cubs).</div></blockquote><br /><br />This doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would Boras tell LA/SF that the Phillies aren't really in it?  Then they know the Phillies offer is irrelevant (the opposite of market setting) and LA/SF just ignore it when bidding.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JFLNYC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>mcare89 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>JFLNYC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>mcare89 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>JFLNYC wrote:</cite>I think the Phils have had the best deal on offer throughout this process. If Harper were excited in the least about playing in Philly the deal would have been done long ago. He’s just not into us.  At this point I’d think very seriously about just pulling the offer — not an ultimatum, just pulling the offer — wishing him well and moving on from this circus.</div></blockquote><br />What do you have to gain from that at this point other than getting to dump him before he (maybe) dumps you?<br /><br />And I disagree with the idea that this could have been done a long time ago if Harper just wanted to play here or if the Phillies had a better offer on the table a month ago (the latter point is not your argument, I know) just one I've seen a lot. You're seeing now exactly why he didn't sign, because now you've supposedly got teams jumping in left and right whose interest was supposedly tepid or non-existent. I definitely don't think the Phillies are his first choice, but I also don't give a shit who his first, second, third, fourth, or 29th choice was if he signs the contract.<br /><br />Boras played this masterfully. Now you've got to play out the string and hope you come out on top.</div></blockquote><br /><br />It’s a huge commitment to make to someone who views your team as, at best, his second choice. I’d be worried it could turn to crap with Harper and his family looking for a way out from the first day he sets foot in camp.  Middleton and Klentak are obviously in the best position to make that judgment so I’ll trust them but it just may not be the right fit.</div></blockquote><br />I think this is some serious projection. There's a huge difference between &quot;not my first choice&quot; and &quot;I actively don't want to live/play there.&quot;  If he really doesn't want to play here, I just don't think he's going to sign here, plain and simple. If he gets the record contract he wants, it's not like that deal is going to be super-tradeable, so he's going to be stuck there until at least his opt-out, whenever that is.</div></blockquote><br /><br />It’s not a projection, serious or otherwise. It’s a concern about giving a record-setting contract to someone who is ambivalent about playing here or, as you even put it, “stuck” here. As I said, Middleton and Klentak are in the best position to make that judgment and I trust that between them they’ve got the experience and sophistication to make a good call. But if you’re not at least concerned about making someone your highest-paid employee when that someone and his family may view you as a consolation prize, you haven’t employed enough people in your life. By no means am I saying the concern can’t be addressed but it also can’t be ignored.</div></blockquote><br />If he doesn't want to sign here, he won't. If he really wants to play for the Dodgers that bad, he'll just fucking sign there. It's not like they're trading for him or has no free will in this situation. Nobody's putting a gun to his head, and Scott Boras works for him. If he agrees to sign a ten-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, I feel pretty good about the fact that all of the consternation about this will be a thing of the past almost instantly. It's not a consolation prize if it's his choice to make.</div>

			<div class="content">I think the thing that will bug me is the likely fact that machado could be in camp right now and we could have already possibly traded franco and maybe another piece to upgrade somewhere else. Maybe we never could have gotten him, but it sure looks like it was just the matter of upping the offer a bit. I preferred him anyway.<br /><br />And I don't think Trout is coming here if we are slogging along a little above .500 and Realmuto is on his way out the door. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but he's going to want to win a championship in his career. Our move happens now or it may not happen. I think that's the reality, sunny optimism aside.</div>

			<div class="content">Because he has the entire rest of the league to deal with the in the future. You think he cares about pissing off one team? Come on, this guy is a shark. <br /><br /><br />He'd talk with LA and SF and tell them to be patient, make other signings, because at the end of the day the real competition is between the West Coast clubs. Let Boras be the bad guy, work the Phillies front office like he has, and late in the game we can start with the real negotiations after the Phils have set a benchmark. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>etched Chaos wrote:</cite>Here's the thing if Bryce had no intention of signing for us, why the fuck would Boras talk to the teams he does want to join about roping us in?

He fully understands that there are very few teams with the willingness to pay a client of his over $300m, pissing off a big spender hurts him in the long-run. Also, no self-respecting money-maker would burn bridges with someone he can do future business with and he'd do this for what? To appease LA/Sf in an utterly pointless endeavour? <br /><br />Phillies being involved doesn't help those two, at all. I still have no idea why you think he'd bring in a 3rd team the other two teams have been told about if those two are the only bidders. A 3rd team drives up the price, if those two are the only bidders they'd actively want him to get rid of anyone with no shot as to keep the price low. Boras would actually be fucking over Bryce by doing what you think he is. His job is to get his client the best deal, not to compeltely salt the earth with the highest bidder so two teams can get him at a much lower price. <br /><br />Also, Boras has never done shit like that before, why would he start now?</div>

			<div class="content">Because it's done as a favor to Boras' hometown team (Dodgers) and the Giants (where Harper wants to play). I understand what you are saying - he could just use the Phils as dupes to raise the price, but the Dodgers and Giants knew they were going to pay a lot no matter what, but letting Boras use another team as a price setter allows them to focus efforts. Hell, for all we know Boras was calling LA and SF and letting them know what the Phils were offering as the process expanded over time. They could have told him that they weren't in the game at any time, but they didn't. <br /><br />PIsses me off to have to deal with shitheads like this (Boras). Not good for the game. Might be good for the players, but the worst case scenario to me is if he ends up with LA...then you have a three team super league with the Dodgers, Yankees and Red Sox and everyone else. Manfred needs to get some more competitive balance back within the game or the MLB is going to be like the NBA.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Squire wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Luzinski's Gut wrote:</cite>Here's how I think this played out. <br /><br />Boras told LA and SF at the start that Harper only wants to play for them. He says we can leverage Philly because they have an owner who can't keep his mouth shut about spending money, so let them set the market, and once I get a firm offer from them, I'll come back to you and we can start the serious negotiations. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Boras uses the whores in the baseball press like a fiddle, giving out small indications of info without giving away the real game, which is how to maximize SF and LA. So he uses the White Sox and Nats at first, they fall out, he lets the Phils squirm for a while, then I think he gets the ultimatum from Middleton last week. <br /><br />That's when he makes the SF and LA news public, sure the Phils can see themselves as a contender, but Boras has already achieved what he wanted - to ensure his client plays where he wants, cranked up the AAV and over all price to set the market between SF and LA. He can always go back to Philly because they have a GM who a quant and blabbed about overvaluation with Machado and an owner who is going to lose significant credibility with his fan base...they can be counted on to do what needs to be done, useful idiots as Lenin said.<br /><br />We aren't getting Harper and we never were. This was the long scam between Boras, Harper, and the two West Coast teams. <br /><br />It's under 1% he's coming here. And it's always been that way. <br /><br />For Middleton and Klentak to set up this scenario as the primary and secondary courses of action is mind blowingly stupid. Sure, they've added some real nice pieces, but they aren't going to the playoffs this year minus a small miracle. The real question is - does the Boras model get adopted by the rest of the league with the Phillies and free agents? I'd give it about 24-36 months to determine the impact on future free agents and their desire to play in Philly.<br /><br /><br />The Phils are already fighting against the glamour teams of SoCal, the glitz of NYC, the weird Boston fetish that somehow has emerged over the last two decades, and even the Texan big market/no state income tax teams. <br /><br /><br />The Phils better find another way to sell the team, the city, the area, because we might be seeing a slow semi-permanent fossilization as the best second tier team in the country (along with the Cubs).</div></blockquote><br /><br />This doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would Boras tell LA/SF that the Phillies aren't really in it?  Then they know the Phillies offer is irrelevant (the opposite of market setting) and LA/SF just ignore it when bidding.</div></blockquote></div>

A favour that will cost him millions of dollars and his client millions of dollars. Also, what fucking Agent gives a hometown team a favour on a deal of this scale? <br /><br />Not to mention both teams only wanted to get Bryce on a short-term deal, our being involved, is driving either to 10 years $300m+.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm laughing my ass off because I can see an angry Irishman and his accent in these words. <br /><br />He doesn't need many teams. If Harper tells him I want LA or SF, and that's it, well, that's it. Boras has to create the market then to an extent. He did that in spades. If doesn't bring in the other teams, then LA and SF have negotiating leverage over him...LA says &quot;hey we have this salary tax issue, we can't spend much money, Kershaw is going to need surgery and he's wicked expensive,&quot; SF can say, look we aren't interested in him unless it's a short term deal, well, Boras can use the Phils as the driver for getting the Giants to contemplate a long term deal. <br /><br />I'm not saying all of this happened, I am just stating my case that Boras is a shark, he's got almost $2B of MLB contracts under his belt, and he's got an owner saying he wants to spend stupid money...that's a recipe for a Scrooge McDuck money back in freshly minted greenbacks,<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>etched Chaos wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Luzinski's Gut wrote:</cite>Because he has the entire rest of the league to deal with the in the future. You think he cares about pissing off one team? Come on, this guy is a shark. <br /><br /><br />He'd talk with LA and SF and tell them to be patient, make other signings, because at the end of the day the real competition is between the West Coast clubs. Let Boras be the bad guy, work the Phillies front office like he has, and late in the game we can start with the real negotiations after the Phils have set a benchmark. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>etched Chaos wrote:</cite>Here's the thing if Bryce had no intention of signing for us, why the fuck would Boras talk to the teams he does want to join about roping us in?

He fully understands that there are very few teams with the willingness to pay a client of his over $300m, pissing off a big spender hurts him in the long-run. Also, no self-respecting money-maker would burn bridges with someone he can do future business with and he'd do this for what? To appease LA/Sf in an utterly pointless endeavour? <br /><br />Phillies being involved doesn't help those two, at all. I still have no idea why you think he'd bring in a 3rd team the other two teams have been told about if those two are the only bidders. A 3rd team drives up the price, if those two are the only bidders they'd actively want him to get rid of anyone with no shot as to keep the price low. Boras would actually be fucking over Bryce by doing what you think he is. His job is to get his client the best deal, not to compeltely salt the earth with the highest bidder so two teams can get him at a much lower price. <br /><br />Also, Boras has never done shit like that before, why would he start now?</div></blockquote></div>

See what those chumps have to say then when he comes into town and meteor showers the outfield stands with long balls.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is a pretty good use of irony. I'll complain about everyone losing patience and being all emotional by going all emotional to the extent of hoping an opposing player comes in and destroys my favorite team in their own ballpark.<br /><br />Everyone's tired and wants a conclusion, we all can understand that. I can forgive people some ignorant comments at a time like this...not that I've even really noticed anyone specifically saying they don't want him to sign here.<br /><br />I think JFLNYC had a reasoned approach a few pages back. Do we still want him here and don't care about the price because it isn't our cash? Sure. Might we also be OK if he doesn't sign here because at some point the contract could become a burdensome albatross? Certainly a possibility. I think that's a fair way to compartmentalize whatever result we get.</div>
