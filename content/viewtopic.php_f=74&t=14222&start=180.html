			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>phdave wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>James Fallowes is calling this argument &quot;the pros versus the quants.&quot; It does kind of resemble a scouts-vs.-statheads dynamic: some pundits and many Republicans arguing that Romney has the Big Mo and fire in the belly and the Good Face, while Silver, and not a few other guys running simulations, are still pretty sure Obama will win owing to structural factors. <br /><br />Both arguments strike me as having some merit. But I'm starting to think that if the election had been held this week, that momentum might have been decisive; as it is, I think the extra time will facilitate the fundamentals, which probably help the president, reasserting themselves. <br /><br />It is all about who votes. The larger the electorate, the better Obama's chances. The thru-line of all the polls and interviews is a dispute over who will turn out.</div></blockquote><br />But it's more than the pros vs. the quants. RCP has Romney up 0.7 in their national average. Pollster.com at Huffington Post has Romney up 0.2 in their national average. TalkingPointsMemo has Obama up 0.9 in their average.<br /><br />RCP is run by Republicans and the other two are run by Dems so the difference in polls they include explains most of the difference in the poll averages. But all three are short of where Silver has the race at - Obama +1.4%. Nate is relying more on state polls to build out that lead and also has underlying economic stuff thrown in (though at a decreasing amount of the model). His model is anywhere from 0.5-2.3% more positive for Obama nationally than the three biggest national polling aggregator sites.</div></blockquote><br /><br />They aren't comparable that way.  RCP, pollster, and TPM are calculating current averages.  None of their Romney+Obama %s even add up to 100%.  There's no third party candidate getting 5-6%, so they are not forecasting the outcome. Nate is modeling the outcome based on data and weighting assumptions. His assumptions could be wrong but he is doing something different than they are.  <br /><br />/I really don't know what I'm talking about</div></blockquote><br />They're doing different things, but computing an average of where the race stands at the moment according to national polls is not going with your gut. It's not an argument based on momentum. The race nationally appears to be just about tied. Nate's model has Obama ahead by 1.4%.  <br /><br />Nate pointed the other day to the fact that if you ran simulations based on RCP's unadjusted state polling averages Obama would be about a 2-1 favorite to win the electoral college as well. Which is all well and good, but that doesn't explain the discrepancy between what Nate's model says is going on nationally and everyone else. <br /><br />The 538 model is marginally more favorable to Obama nationally than the polling averages are, and the marginal difference makes a huge difference in the probability of him winning the popular vote (and electoral college depending on how it's all tied together).</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Bucky wrote:</cite>is he weighting the undecideds where the others are not??  <br /><br />/meneither</div></blockquote><br />Undecideds tend to break toward the outparty. The old 2-1 against the incumbent or if the incumbent is under 50% heading into election day rules of thumb aren't quite right, but I don't know what the argument would be for allocating undecideds to help Obama.</div>

And the president, in turn, has largely eliminated Romney's edge among men.<br /><br />Those churning gender dynamics leave the presidential race still a virtual dead heat, with Romney favored by 47 percent of likely voters and Obama by 45 percent, a result within the poll's margin of sampling error, the survey shows.<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br />At the same time, expectations that Obama will be re-elected have slipped: Half of voters now expect the president to win a second term, down from 55 percent a month earlier.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Romney's pitch to women has been focused squarely on the economy, making the case that what women want most is to ensure their families and their country are on a solid financial footing. The poll shows that message appears to be taking root.<br /><br />A month ago, women favored Obama over Romney on the economy 56 percent to 40 percent. Now, the split has shifted to 49 percent for Romney and 45 percent for Obama.<br /><br />Similarly, Obama's lead among women as the candidate who better understands the people's problems has narrowed considerably, from a 58-36 Obama advantage last month to a 50-43 Obama edge now.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Ginny Lewis, a Democrat and 72-year-old retired district attorney from Princeton, Ky., says she'll vote for Romney because &quot;I'm tired of the Republicans blaming all the debt on Democrats, so let them take over and see what they do.&quot;<br /><br />Not that she's optimistic about how that will turn out, though. &quot;I think things will get worse before they get better,&quot; she said.<br /><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />thank you, ginny.</div>

But I'm starting to think that if the election had been held this week, that momentum might have been decisive; as it is, I think the extra time will facilitate the fundamentals, which probably help the president, reasserting themselves. <br /><br />It is all about who votes. The larger the electorate, the better Obama's chances. The thru-line of all the polls and interviews is a dispute over who will turn out.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Did you read Nate Silver's piece today before writing this post?  If not, very apt timing.<br /><br /><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/oct-24-in-polls-romneys-momentum-seems-to-have-stopped/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/oct-24-in-polls-romneys-momentum-seems-to-have-stopped/</a></div></blockquote><br /><br />No, I just read it a few minutes ago and admittedly thought, &quot;Damn, I'm good.&quot;<br /><br />thephan, a prof of mine from grad school, Judy Feder, ran against Frank Wolf a few cycles back. Judy would have been a really good public servant, and probably a serious player in healthcare reform (her area of expertise including a stint in the Clinton administration). But she couldn't win in multiple tries, and I suspect that scared off the DCCC for the remainder of Wolf's career.</div>

The challenging candidate has typically been underrated by head-to-head polls when he is still engaged in a heated primary battle, when his name recognition is low, or both. These effects seem to evaporate by April of the election year or so, when the result of the nomination process is likely to have become clear and when the presumptive nominee is likely to have become widely known to voters.<br /><br />2. The evidence is not very convincing that polls break toward the challenger otherwise. (This seems to be true both for presidential elections and for other types of elections.)<br /><br />3. In presidential years, the mean-reversion tendency in polls has been much clearer than any effects from incumbent status.<br /><br />4. The effects of the conventions can skew poll analysis and can lead candidates to be underrated (particularly the incumbent-party candidate after the challenger’s convention) if it is not accounted for.<br /><br />5. The analysis is complicated by the fact that there are different ways to define incumbent candidates, by the small sample size, and by the fact that the way voters respond to polls may be changing. So — although I do not think the evidence for the incumbent rule is very convincing — keep an open mind to the effects of incumbency status as we gather more data from this and from future election years.</div></blockquote><br />So he seems more comfortable explaining challenger gains with reversion to mean rather than undecideds breaking their way, but according to the chart below - and all small sample size warnings are appropriate of course - there seems to be at least something going on in Oct/Nov and challengers doing better than their polls. <br /><br /><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/07/21/us/538-chart2/538-chart2-blog480.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

			<div class="content">My other point would be that there might not be all that many undecideds. The sorts of polls we're seeing now at the state level tend to be numbers like 50-47, 49-48, 48-46. I guess when you have a 48-46, there are enough undecideds that if they break conclusively enough (no, I will not attempt the math), it could be decisive. But when the lead candidate is at 49 or 50, as is often/usually the case here, a wave won't matter unless there's some weakness in that number to start with.</div>

			<div class="content">listened to an interview with jeffrey toobin, who appears to be the most inside obama's head.  basically, it's roberts v obama with the supreme court. obama believes political change comes from elected officials, not the courts.  roberts believes the opposite. obama is about preserving status quo at the supreme court, while roberts is all about activism with the SC.<br /><br />interesting contrast to their supposed liberal/conservative paintings in the media.<br /><br />also liked hearing about ginsberg being approved with 90+ votes in 1993 when she was the head of hte ACLU women's rights project, never held her liberal views close to the vest, etc.  the SC goes back and forth between being a political tool and not.</div>

The sorts of polls we're seeing now at the state level tend to be numbers like 50-47, 49-48, 48-46. I guess when you have a 48-46, there are enough undecideds that if they break conclusively enough (no, I will not attempt the math), it could be decisive. But when the lead candidate is at 49 or 50, as is often/usually the case here, a wave won't matter unless there's some weakness in that number to start with.</div></blockquote><br />i'm tired of hearing about undecideds.  we're cowtowing to a bunch of morons who haven't been able to decide between these two guys yet?  if i hear the word, i tune out.</div>
