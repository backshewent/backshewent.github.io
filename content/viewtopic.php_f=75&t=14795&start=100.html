I have always viewed it as operating independantly from the Government control which I view as not being an arm of the governemnt for propaganda and media control, but I never really viewed this as creating a conduit for exposing confidential or classified information. If that were the interpretation, why wouldn't a press entity pop up that served as a means of publishing classified information sponsored by foriegn governments as a legitimized, white (for hire) spy agency? Imagine esponage going significantly to open source because creating a media outlet that just deals in exposed secrets has protection. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_press" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">The ever reliable wiki would agree with my asertion that classified information is out of bounds.</a><br /><br />Regarding freedom of expression, I think that is a slippery slope at best. This would be more to giving Snowden a platform for expression. I think that is why this is being played more as a whistle blower action. He has thought this through pretty well for a guy who dropped out of high school, community college and the Army -- but also a good question as he was able to connect with the USG as an employee at this level then take over $120K/year from BAH. Perhaps that is character assination, but he does not seem to be able to stick with much. So expressing his opinion seems sketchy. As for the press, the press is not expressing its expression, it is acting as a business -- which it is obligated to do.<br /><br />So to circle this back to the press, can you make the case that it is in reciept of recieving stolen property in the form of information?</div>

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked the intelligence czar if the NSA gathers &quot;any type of data at all on millions of Americans.”<br /><br />&quot;No, sir,&quot; Clapper responded. &quot;Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.&quot;<br /><br />Clapper's response appears to contradict recent revelations about the agency's large scale phone records collection program, first reported on by the Guardian last week. However, during the NBC interview, Clapper said Wyden's question did not have a straightforward answer. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;I thought, though in retrospect, I was asked -- 'When are you going to start -- stop beating your wife' kind of question, which is meaning not -- answerable necessarily by a simple yes or no,&quot; Clapper said in the interview, which aired Sunday. &quot;So I responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful, manner by saying 'no'.&quot; </span><br />Clapper said his remarks also reflected his definition of &quot;collection,&quot; which he said has a specific meaning in an intelligence context. <br /><br />&quot;What I was thinking of is looking at the Dewey Decimal numbers-- of those books in that metaphorical library-- to me, collection of U.S. persons' data would mean taking the book off the shelf and opening it up and reading it,&quot; he said. <br /><br />In a Tuesday statement, Wyden said he had notified Clapper of his question in advance, and had given his office a chance to give a &quot;straight answer&quot; after the March hearing. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">“So that he would be prepared to answer, I sent the question to Director Clapper’s office a day in advance. After the hearing was over my staff and I gave his office a chance to amend his answer,” Wyden said. “Now public hearings are needed to address the recent disclosures and the American people have the right to expect straight answers from the intelligence leadership to the questions asked by their representatives.&quot;</span><br /></div></blockquote></div>

Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked whether it was true that the NSA had the ability to tap into Americans’ phone calls and electronic communications.<br /><br />“False. I know of no way to do that,” Alexander responded.</span><br />The NSA chief, who is also a four-star Army general who oversees the U.S. Cyber Command, said he is pressing to declassify information on how often the information has been useful. “I’m pushing for that,” he said. “We do want to get this right and it has to be vetted across the community so what we give you, you know, is accurate.”</div></blockquote><br />you know of no way to tap someone's phone calls?? come on. she didnt even ask if they WERE doing it, whether it was legal or illegal, but asked CAN you?  and yes, you can. we had this show called 'The Wire' and everything.<br /><br />Tester brings up a good point:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) expressed outrage that the man who has admitted to the leaks, 29-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, had access to wide array of top-secret information while working as a computer administrator. Tester noted that after the massive leak to WikiLeaks several years ago, the federal government supposedly moved to put stricter limits on access to secrets.<br /><br />“Whatever one thinks of Edward Snowden, it looks to me like we’ve also got a big problem that is internal, not external,” the senator said, questioning the current focus on cyberattacks.<br /><br />“The president has requested $13 billion in cyber spending for FY14. And yet a contractor, not even somebody who’s accountable to your chain of command or anyone else in the government, is able to get his hands on a copy of a FISA court order allowing the collection of metadata from Verizon. How on earth does this happen?” Tester asked. “And why does a contractor have access to information that we’re spending $13 billion to prevent outsiders from getting their hands on?”<br /><br />Alexander echoed the point. “That’s one of the grave concerns we both have,” Alexander replied. He said the basic computer work at NSA “was outsourced about 14 years ago.”<br />We have system administrators who are contractors, working and running our networks. They don’t have total visibility of the network, but they get key parts to it,” the general added. “This individual was a system administration with access to key parts of the network. We’ve got to address that….It’s something that we’ve got to fix.”<br /><br />Under questioning from Tester, Alexander said he wasn’t prepared to declare “yet” that the work should be done by government employees. “There are good contractors out there that are doing a good job,” he said</div></blockquote><br />if this is so damned important to be kept under our hats, perhaps we shouldn't be involving contractors whose #1 concern is making money. but then, the revolving door in DC wouldn't be fed.</div>

In WWI, WWII, Korea, and Viet Nam the US could not confirm the identity of a heck of a lot more than a quarter of the people killed in bombing raids and infantry operations.  In a war you don't need to know who you are killing, you just need to know they are the enemy.  And, even when you scrupulously try to shoot at only the enemy, some civilians will be killed.  This is especially so in wars like Aghanistan and Viet Nam where the baddies like to hide out among civilians for safety.  Now, you can say if you can't always be 100% sure that the baddies aren't hiding with civilians, then you can't fire.  But you can't fight and win a war like this.  If that's the choice then you really shouldn't fight the war in the first place.  I'm all in for saying we really should not have fought the Viet Nam war and Iraq II and that we should have ended Afghanistan years ago, but we as a nation, or at least the President and Congress, decided to fight these wars.  To me, it is inane and hypocritical to expect that a war will be conducted in a wholly antiseptic manner, with 25% not positively identified victims being somehow unacceptable.  If this is unacceptable, then the solution is to never fight a war.  It is the liberal equivalent of Bush and Lyndon Johnson pretending that the nation wasn't really at war, asking no sacrifice of the general populace, deciding that we could have guns and butter, and just telling people to do their part by shopping.</div>
