			<div class="content">If you're counting on jewels of wisdom, then this shouldn't take too long.
<br />
<br />Voice what you believe in. ... If people don't like it, then oh well.
<br />
<br />You're not really getting your point across - you're not really making any sort of impact whatsoever - if you don't have somebody criticize you.
<br />
<br />I've never been arrested.
<br />
<br />The guy is a little overboard, but as far as what he's done promoting his passion and passions, ... Ted Nugent ... is all about gun rights and promoting outdoor sports and stuff like that. I've been on a couple of conference calls with Ted and been backstage at a couple of the shows when he was touring with Lynyrd Skynyrd. ... You get done listening to him and you're like, &quot;This guy's not some ... idiot rock player.&quot; I mean, he's a guy that's actually very intelligent.
<br />
<br />You tend to succeed to the level that you overcome your doubts and fears.
<br />
<br />I think I was suspended from school one time for being tardy too many times. ... I was just too stubborn to set my alarm clock for five minutes earlier.
<br />
<br />If you sit back and think, &quot;Well, I'm scared, I may fail,&quot; how is that benefitting you in any way? Give it a shot. Do the best you can.
<br />
<br />People are so hellbent to be spoon-fed everything. They don't want to use deductive reasoning and come up with their own opinions. ... They basically want to sit back and open their mind up like it's a garage door and just let anybody park any level of crap in their head. ... I guess it's just the sheepish nature of people. They are basically sheep.
<br />
<br />The dumbest thing in the world? That's easy. Liberalism.
<br />
<br />I was just sitting here watching Fox News and you've got some idiot left-wing liberal out in California - shocker - trying to get ... &quot;under God&quot; removed from our Pledge of Allegiance.
<br />
<br />A lot of people like to sit around and talk sports, and I'll talk sports with you. But if you want to really get me going, then the political buttons are the ones to push.
<br />
<br />Jack Ellis did a pretty good job, didn't he? How'd that whole expense-account thing turn out? What is his name Sharah Astah Muhammad now?
<br />
<br />Losing is probably the best teacher.
<br />
<br />You can't draw every analogy in life to baseball.
<br />
<br />There's always people telling you, &quot;You can't, you can't, you can't,&quot; no matter what walk of life you're in. It's a battle always trying to push back the doubters and push back the negative commentators and look at them and say, &quot;I can.&quot;
<br />
<br />You don't know anything for sure.
<br />
<br />I start feeling antsy if I sit still too long.
<br />
<br />I think it's the result of perfection when you set a goal - and my goal was to throw 100 miles an hour - and when you can see the ball and you can feel it come out of your hand crisp and you can almost hear that snap as the seams release from your fingers.
<br />
<br />I guess I really show my negative emotion a different way than crying. I'm one of those, I'm a yeller. When something upsetting happens, I tend to get mad.
<br />
<br />If you can abide by the law of &quot;it's all about the girl I'm with,&quot; then you'll never be alone.
<br />
<br />I think I'm done with my debauchery, at least most of it.
<br />
<br />I don't really read my own press.
<br />
<br />Try to keep as many people around you that make you happy and as many things around you that make you happy.
<br />
<br />Being in the Rocky Mountains and stalking elk all day, that's an unbelievable thing. To watch the sun rise over the snow-capped Rocky Mountain range and hearing elk bugle and bugles are bouncing off the canyon walls.
<br />
<br />The worst sound in the world? ... When I'm aiming at an animal and all I hear is &quot;click.&quot;
<br />
<br />I ate dog one time in Mexico. I didn't know it was dog until after I ate it. ... They had it on the menu as &quot;flank steak.&quot; I just saw the word &quot;steak,&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, get me one of those.&quot; ... I don't know what kind of dog it was, but it really, seriously, was dog.
<br />
<br />Sixty-eight percent of all marriages in the United States end up in divorce, and you have a lot better chance of ending up a statistic than you do of having a good marriage. I had a real good friend of mine that's just absolutely just loaded, worth every bit of a hundred million. ... He's been married, divorced and, of course, given away half. ... He'd been dating some girl for three or four months and I'm like, &quot;You think you'll ever get married again?&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, I'm a businessman. What business decision would I make where I had a 68-percent chance of losing half my investment?&quot;
<br />
<br />People think Smalltown, USA, only exists in the South and-or possibly the Midwest.
<br />
<br />Back in my late teens and early 20s, I didn't really understand the value of sentimentality and retaining a part of good experiences. I don't think I took enough pictures and didn't keep enough keepsakes. I would love to have a little bit of the ivy from Wrigley Field.
<br />
<br />I'm a little chapped that they're gonna tear down Yankee Stadium.
<br />
<br />If I can get some real estate sold, I'm in the market for a new Ferrari.

<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Rocker (Will Ferrell): SHUT UP! Alright, Colin. Let's go. I'm John Rocker, here to launch us into a new millenium with a message of peace and love. First off, to all the mangy baboons who call themselves citizens of New York, may you spend the next hundred years watching your queer Mets go down on the homosexual Yankees!<br /><br />Colin: (shocked) Hey now! Hey, John!<br /><br />Rocker: (angrily) What?! (crowd booing) YOU SHUT UP!! Hey Quinn, what's your problem, you dirty CH**K! (more booing)<br /><br />Colin: (disgusted) Now, come on, John!<br /><br />Rocker: (burning with rage at the audience) SHUT UP!! What are you looking at, you homo MEXICANS?? Any of you ever been bow hunting? I bow hunt! I love my FATHER! I love IRON EAGLE MOVIES! You all aint half the man my daddy is, Popeye John Rocker Senior!<br /><br />Colin: John, what about your message for the new year?<br /><br />Rocker: (to himself) Right. Stay focused, Rocker. Daddy's watching. Go hard, like WWF. (to audience) Okay, second, in the new millenium, I hope that we can all join together to track down that black baby that the Jews and the Pope had together and kill it before it can destroy the world.<br /><br />Colin: Uh, I think that's enough.<br /><br />Rocker: (yelling at audience) Now am I GETTING THROUGH TO YOU, you MAN-KISSERS? The Braves and white people rule! (loud booing) Yeah, that's right. I'm John Rocker! I sign my name with an X! I eat rat poison! Cause I can't read the BOX! In high school I killed an Iranian kid! And guess what, New York? I looked up under the Statue of Liberty's dress, and she's got a DONG! That aint no lady, that's a hippie transvectulite y'all got there, smokin her DOPE PIPE!! (sniffing the air) Hey Quinn, you know what, I smell 'Rican. You got 'Rican blood in you?<br /><br />Colin: (disgusted) Aww, c'mon, that is just awful, John.<br /><br />(more loud booing in audience)<br /><br />Rocker: (standing and shouting) THAT'S RIGHT! HATE ME! COME ON, NEW YORK, HATE ME AND BOO!! Cause I know I'm a good man when the DEVIL hates me! I'm JOHN ROCKER! I'll fight ALL of you, you cesspool of HOMO RACE TRAITORS! (kneeling on Weekend Update desk and pulling down his pants) I'M GONNA PISS ON YOU, NEW YORK! DRINK MY PISS, YOU FILTHY HOMO GYPSIES! YEAH, I'M GONNA TAKE A.. (security guards move out to escort him away) YOU GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME, YOU ANIMALS! LET ME GO! I THROW BASEBALLS! (Rocker starts crying) Daddy! DADDY!! Make them stop hurting me, help me daddy! (to security guards) Stop hurting me! I'll suck your pee-pee. Stop hurting meeeee!<br /><br />John Rocker is dragged off the stage by security.</div></blockquote></div>
