<br />
<br />I don't think we have a leader at the moment, and agree trying to argue over which person is the leader of the party would be stupid because there is no answer. There are a number of people who are influential within the party. If I was to come up with a list of ten, off the top of my head I would say Rush, Beck, Steele, and Boehner from your list plus McConnell, Romney, Jindal, Pawlenty, McCain and Palin. Rush and Beck are more influential than McConnell or Boehner at getting people to show up angry at town hall meetings or march on the Capitol. McConnell, McCain and Boehner are sure as hell going to have more of a say though in what type of a stance the GOP caucuses take on the health care bill and on the Afghanistan debate, and those things matter a lot too. And the presidential contenders have a special place in the party leadership discussion because all of their internal ideological jockeying will become the most important down the line when one of them is picked as the nominee.
<br />
<br />In closing, a party that had John McCain as its presidential nominee eleven months ago is not de facto led by Rush Limbaugh. Period.</div>

The big increase was largely because of a spike in energy costs in 2008.<br /><br />Inflation has been negative this year largely because energy prices have fallen.

<br />
<br />I really don't think Rush, and certainly not Beck are all that influential in <span style="font-style: italic">Republican </span>circles. The think about populist punditry is that it only has influence in opposition--so, starting with the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme court and Bush's attempt at immigration reform, Rush (did Beck even have a national audience then?) Rush began a return back to relevance. 
<br />
<br />But I don't think the Republican leadership pays Limbaugh or Beck much attention.</div>

<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Certainly, you can see where the Corzine campaign is hoping to go with this one. Let your mind run wild with the not-so-subtle implications: Christie is a fat slob who is underprepared for the pressures of office, a fat cat who will sell out to the special interests, etc. Undoubtedly, their crack research staff uncovered some evidence that Christie's weight is a vulnerability, or at least could be associated with other negatives about him.<br /><br />But it's one thing for your opponent's weight to be a vulnerability, and another thing to point that out to the voters without looking like an a-hole.<br /><br />There have been many, many campaigns waged over the years that deftly (or not-so-deftly) implied that the opponent was a closet homosexual, Muslim, communist, or atheist. But being fat isn't like those other things: it's something that everyone can see for themselves. There is no plus-sized closet for fat people, so to speak. And our nation's relationship with obesity and obese people is complicated. Although fat people are perhaps by default objects of disdain, it doesn't take very much to turn them into everyman-ish Bubbas -- objects of sympathy.<br /><br />Corzine remains in a much better position than he was a month ago. But if this is his campaign's idea of an endgame, he's liable to send Christie's big, fat ass to Trenton.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I think there is an implied assumption that even fat people dislike other fat people.  Though this may be true (I just don't know), at some point that's going to backfire depending on the context (like a political race).  You can't go on about how fat America is and count on all those fatties always agreeing with you - particularly if they feel like they're being manipulated.</div>

<br />
<br />I thought Rush replaced Soros. Which would now mean they need someone else. (Perot?)
<br />
<br />As you know, politics has nothing to do with this. All the NFL guys care about is growing their business, which probably is the way it should be.</div>

<br />
<br />Again, I'm not saying old people need this money. But my understanding is that COLA calculations systematically don't work out for old people. That is, the stuff seniors buy (especially health care) have gone up much faster than overall inflation, which has been held down by declining prices for stuff seniors don't buy, like computers and cellphones. 
<br />
<br />Since as a group, seniors are better off than most Americans, if there is to be any money kicked that way, it should be reserved for those relatively few seniors who really are poor. That's especially because this recession probably hasn't hit seniors all that hard at all--they're not looking for jobs, and they're unlikely to be upside on their mortgage.</div>
