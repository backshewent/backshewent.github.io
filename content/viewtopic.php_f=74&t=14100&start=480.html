Who the heck was voting for Romney before that and isn't anymore? Tempest in a teapot.</div></blockquote><br />You don't think there's some mildly conservative suburban housewife who was kinda sorta leaning towards voting for Romney but now won't because he's been further exposed as a jackass?  She might just not vote at all.<br /><br />I mean, by that rationale, Romney could get busted with a bag of coke in his pocket and he wouldn't lose any significant national numbers because it's not like any of those people are switching to Obama.<br /><br />More importantly for Romney, it precludes him from making gains.  He's the trailing candidate who needs nearly all of the battleground states.  Obama should be content with running out the clock.</div>

But an issue like the 47% is not that issue because hardly anyone sees themselves as the people Romney's talking about. The very few that do were voting Obama anyway, maybe it spurs their enthusiasm a little bit to make sure they GOTV?<br /><br />Silver said it was not a helpful thing to say, and I agree with that, but there's a difference.</div>

			<div class="content">the parties are so separated at the moment that absolutely neither guy could do to affect the outcome IMO.<br /><br />Obama has more voters in higher EV states than Romney does and thats the end of the story.  no one is going to change their mind.  the idea that people haven't made up their mind yet blows my mind.  its too hard to sit on a fence this long when you have two absolutely completely different ideologies running against each other.<br /><br />i'm sure JH has some sort of polling to say otherwise</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jeff2sf wrote:</cite>It's so negligible as to be kind of pointless. Would I have said it? No, of course not. But Nate Silver had a pretty reasonable take on it specifically and gaffes in general. They just don't matter as much as people who follow this stuff think they do. I mean the Libya stuff was brutal last week, and if anything Romney's polls have ticked up. &quot;Yeah but this is different&quot;... &quot;No, it's really not&quot;.</div></blockquote><br />I realize it's semantics, but I was responding to whoever it was that said that it wouldn't change anyone's mind.  <br /><br />I think the bigger problem isn't a hypothetical poll hit (which would likely be within the MOE anyway), but the fact that it becomes the campaign narrative at a time when Obama should be weak due to the most recent job numbers.<br /><br />As for Obama's forecast numbers trending down and Romney up, I think this is an interesting note from Silver today:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The second major reason for the shift is that the model is designed to take a skeptical view of the polls conducted for a candidate who just held his convention. Typically, the polling bounce that a candidate receives from his convention does not evaporate immediately, but can persist for a couple of weeks. We are still close enough to the Democratic convention that this adjustment applies to Mr. Obama’s numbers in the polls.<br /><br />The downward adjustment to Mr. Obama’s numbers will gradually fade out over the next week or so. Thus, if he holds his current position in the polls, he will begin to regain ground in the FiveThirtyEight forecast.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I also think the Libya comments play differently.  Very few people are going to pay enough attention to that story to (a) understand it and (b) appreciate why what Romney said and did was ridiculous.  To even an uninformed person, the 47% comments reek of Monty Burns and are patently insulting, especially the parts about Latinos.  (For example, my FB feed was pretty quiet about the Libya comments, but even non-politcally-savvy people are talking about Mitt over the past two days.)  Considering that Mitt badly needs the Latino vote to pick up a state like Nevada, these comments could really hurt him even if it doesn't show up in the national numbers.</div>
