<br />
<br />They're both open seats already, so that part's done. I think a lot of the national commentators figured the seats were gone because they're marginal districts nationally, and both of our candidates are at a huge fundraising deficit, but the seats are ancestrally GOP and both of the Dems have taken a lot of bad votes through the years.</div>

<br />
<br />With all due respect, McCain did not actively help Keating wreck the S&L system.  If you want to blame one of the Keating 5, DeConcini is the guy.
<br />
<br />And Obama's relationship is a lot more than simply sitting on a philanthropic board with Ayers as pointed out in the CNN piece and elsewhere.  This relationship is fair game, especially since Obama makes no apologies for hitching the wagon to his political career to his kind on radical.
<br />
<br />And judging by Ayers' recent rhetoric and views, he's still every bit the radical as he was in the 60s and 70s, so his radicalism is anything but &quot;in the past&quot;.</div>

It's too easy for them to get carried away in NJ, which always seems to have polling showing GOPers tantalizingly close to victory in the final weeks. But things are looking up this cycle, as new polling shows GOPers on top in both GOP-held open seats. That situation seemed unimaginable just weeks ago.<br />-- In '06, Dems picked up 30 seats mostly because every competitive race tilted their way. This cycle, if GOPers are to hold on to more vulnerable seats, local factors (like, for example, an unpopular NJ state legislature) will have to play a role. That didn't happen in '06.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Don't $#@! with me.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I would guess that with State Gov. shutdowns, a persistent culture of corruption, and still viable Republican county organizations help. It probably helps that Corzine isn't exactly the most popular governor in the US.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Mountainphan wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>And a not-so-minor point: McCain actively helped Keating wreck the S&L system. Obama sat with Ayers on a philanthropic board, and even this was a quarter-century after Ayers' pseudo-revolutionary incompetence. <br /><br />I'm trying not to get worked up over any of this. But every time either of them mention Ayers or Wright, all I hear is &quot;we have no answers to the country's problems.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />With all due respect, McCain did not actively help Keating wreck the S&L system.  If you want to blame one of the Keating 5, DeConcini is the guy.<br /><br />And Obama's relationship is a lot more than simply sitting on a philanthropic board with Ayers as pointed out in the CNN piece and elsewhere.  This relationship is fair game, especially since Obama makes no apologies for hitching the wagon to his political career to his kind on radical.<br /><br />And judging by Ayers' recent rhetoric and views, he's still every bit the radical as he was in the 60s and 70s, so his radicalism is anything but &quot;in the past&quot;.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The reason I don't want to get into this with you--beyond the second half of my post, which is the real point--is that probably you're always going to initially look to sources that confirm what you want to believe, and so will I. 
<br />
<br />Thus, to you, Obama's &quot;ties&quot; to Ayers aren't really about education or Hyde Park, but either Obama's &quot;bad judgment&quot; or some deep sympathy with Ayers' dumbassed views... and McCain's dalliance with Keating was a youthful indiscretion of political naivete, and an essentially harmless one at that, and Palin's marriage to an Alaska secessionist or religious simpatico with a guy who evidently sees witchcraft everywhere is, I dunno, endearing? 
<br />
<br />I come back with McCain's kissing up to Hagee and Parsley. You make the point that Obama WAS SO CLOSE TO JEREMIAH WRIGHT THAT HE USED A TITLE OF HIS SERMON FOR THE TITLE OF HIS BOOK!!!!
<br />
<br />It's boring, and we're both better than that. Also, I doubt either of us are changing many minds here. 
<br />
<br />In these threads, I think it's best that we all avoid copy-posting stuff that merely and mindlessly confirms our partisan worldviews. I've often failed to live up to this standard, but that's how I'm trying to play it from here on out.</div>

<br />Seriously, phdave, stop with the gotcha message board posts. They really weren't as missed as you think. You don't think tons of Obama supporters parrot lines from Obama's website? There's not really even any problem with it. If Obama has a position on an issue, and I support him, and I want to make an argument supporting Obama, there's a better than even chance that I'm going to make one that has a fair amount of similarities to what Obama wrote. 
<br />
<br />In other words, if I support Obama's position on merit pay, I'm not going to say that the reason I support merit pay for teachers is because I like kittens, kittens are young cats and my teachers name was CATherine just so that no one accuses me of having an argument remarkably similar to Obama's.
<br />
<br />Now of course, I could give less than 2 craps about this Ayers thing or judgment or whatever, but you essentially ignored the issue on judgment so that you could demonstrate, once again, that you know google better than anyone in the history of the world.</div>

<br />Your implication seems fairly obvious.  And if I associated with terrorists, I would expect to be called out on it and asked to explain, especially if I was running for Pres.</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />Except that McCain has recently said that he was innocent in the Keating Affair and that he didn't do anything wrong and it was all just a partisan witchhunt.  Of course, he says this after years of saying the direct opposite, which is that he made mistakes and learned from them.
<br />
<br />Also, the investigation into the Keating affair didn't cover McCain's wife's investment into a mall being built by Keating, so there is stuff out there that hasn't been investigated fully.</div>

<br />
<br />See, this is the really frustrating part of this.  He <span style="font-style: italic">has</span> been questioned about it and has explained what his relationship was.  This has been discussed for months and months.  Many articles have been written about it.  He discussed it in debates.  There were campaign ads about it.  He even was grilled about it on O'Rilley.  I don't know what else to add about it.  It's not some new mysterious accusation that just came out of nowhere.  It's been in McCain's back pocket to bring up again once things started looking bleak and now is the time.  Things were looking bad back in August so he brought it up back then but things turned around after the Palin announcement.  Now things are even worse so suddenly Ayers is a very important subject to talk about again.  
<br />
<br />This is one of those issues that I get a sense is just a bunch of campaign noise that supporters of a campaign throw around to hope that people who aren't really paying much attention start to have negative feelings about a rival candidate.  Remember the nonsense <span style="font-style: italic">concern</span> about the fact that Kerry hadn't released his full military and medical records?  People were screaming about it everywhere.  It was all very <span style="font-style: italic">disturbing</span> that he wasn't telling us everything.  Obviously by not releasing every bit of personal information he had something to hide.  Well, he released his information after the campaign and there was nothing there.  No one cared because by that time the election was over.  I suspect that no one cared to begin with and it was just something to go on and on about on the TV to raise doubts about a candidate.  
<br />
<br />The difference here is that this process already happened during the primaries.  The Ayers accusations have been around and have been dealt with.  Show me something new and I'll deal with it.  Show me something that doesn't add up about what has already been written or the answers that Obama has already given about this in one-on-one interviews with unsympathetic talk show hosts or in debates with a primary opponent who didn't leave any stone unturned in her effort to win the nomination.  
<br />
<br />I'm not convinced that anyone is really concerned about Obama's relationship with Ayers.  This is a political smear.  Palin brings up a NY Times article about it in a speech.  So what that the same article she mentions concludes that there is really nothing to the relationship.  She wasn't trying to debate a point, she is one of the many people trying to smear Obama.  
<br />
<br />Until then, I'm going to treat your effort to bring this up like it is a new, real and important issue (right on cue with the <a href="http://www.blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/10/06/will-mccains-anti-obama-strategy-work.aspx" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">McCain campaign's self proclaimed shift in strategy away from the economy to Obama's character and judgement</a>) as something worthy of mockery.</div>

			<div class="content">I urge everyone to take a look at this article by Rolling Stone about McCain's history of being a &quot;maverick.&quot;  While the author makes some conclusions that I wouldn't in some cases, the quotes from McCain's own biography and some of his former friends and officers (some of them are now highly placed) are worth the read by themselves.  I'm surprised some of this stuff hasn't received more attention.

<br />
<br />Here's one part I found interesting.
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>TRIAL BY FIRE<br /><br />Sometimes 3 a.m. moments occur at 10:52 in the morning.<br /><br />It was July 29th, 1967, a hot, gusty morning in the Gulf of Tonkin atop the four-acre flight deck of the supercarrier USS Forrestal. Perched in the cockpit of his A-4 Skyhawk, Lt. Cmdr. John McCain ticked nervously through his preflight checklist.<br /><br />Now 30 years old, McCain was trying to live up to his father's expectations, to finally be known as something other than the fuck-up grandson of one of the Navy's greatest admirals. That morning, preparing for his sixth bombing run over North Vietnam, the graying pilot's dreams of combat glory were beginning to seem within his reach.<br /><br />Then, in an instant, the world around McCain erupted in flames. A six-foot-long Zuni rocket, inexplicably launched by an F-4 Phantom across the flight deck, ripped through the fuel tank of McCain's aircraft. Hundreds of gallons of fuel splashed onto the deck and came ablaze. Then: Clank. Clank. Two 1,000-pound bombs dropped from under the belly of McCain's stubby A-4, the Navy's &quot;Tinkertoy Bomber,&quot; into the fire.<br /><br />McCain, who knew more than most pilots about bailing out of a crippled aircraft, leapt forward out of the cockpit, swung himself down from the refueling probe protruding from the nose cone, rolled through the flames and ran to safety across the flight deck. Just then, one of his bombs &quot;cooked off,&quot; blowing a crater in the deck and incinerating the sailors who had rushed past McCain with hoses and fire extinguishers. McCain was stung by tiny bits of shrapnel in his legs and chest, but the wounds weren't serious; his father would later report to friends that Johnny &quot;came through without a scratch.&quot;<br /><br />The damage to the Forrestal was far more grievous: The explosion set off a chain reaction of bombs, creating a devastating inferno that would kill 134 of the carrier's 5,000-man crew, injure 161 and threaten to sink the ship.<br /><br />These are the moments that test men's mettle. Where leaders are born. Leaders like . . . Lt. Cmdr. Herb Hope, pilot of the A-4 three planes down from McCain's. Cornered by flames at the stern of the carrier, Hope hurled himself off the flight deck into a safety net and clambered into the hangar deck below, where the fire was spreading. According to an official Navy history of the fire, Hope then &quot;gallantly took command of a firefighting team&quot; that would help contain the conflagration and ultimately save the ship.<br /><br />McCain displayed little of Hope's valor. Although he would soon regale The New York Times with tales of the heroism of the brave enlisted men who &quot;stayed to help the pilots fight the fire,&quot; McCain took no part in dousing the flames himself. After going belowdecks and briefly helping sailors who were frantically trying to unload bombs from an elevator to the flight deck, McCain retreated to the safety of the &quot;ready room,&quot; where off-duty pilots spent their noncombat hours talking trash and playing poker. There, McCain watched the conflagration unfold on the room's closed-circuit television — bearing distant witness to the valiant self-sacrifice of others who died trying to save the ship, pushing jets into the sea to keep their bombs from exploding on deck.<br /><br />As the ship burned, McCain took a moment to mourn his misfortune; his combat career appeared to be going up in smoke. &quot;This distressed me considerably,&quot; he recalls in Faith of My Fathers. &quot;I feared my ambitions were among the casualties in the calamity that had claimed the Forrestal.&quot;<br /><br />The fire blazed late into the night. The following morning, while oxygen-masked rescue workers toiled to recover bodies from the lower decks, McCain was making fast friends with R.W. &quot;Johnny&quot; Apple of The New York Times, who had arrived by helicopter to cover the deadliest Naval calamity since the Second World War. The son of admiralty surviving a near-death experience certainly made for good copy, and McCain colorfully recounted how he had saved his skin. But when Apple and other reporters left the ship, the story took an even stranger turn: McCain left with them. As the heroic crew of the Forrestal mourned its fallen brothers and the broken ship limped toward the Philippines for repairs, McCain zipped off to Saigon for what he recalls as &quot;some welcome R&R.&quot;<br /></div></blockquote>

<br />So while his shipmates bravely fought the fire, McCain hid in the lounge, by his own admission, and watched it unfold on TV.  The next morning, he left his shipmates with the press to go to Saigon for some R&R.  <span style="font-weight: bold">WHAT A FRAUD</span>.  Seriously, I didn't know half this stuff and it's not like he's denied any of it.  In fact, he's confirmed most of it.</div>
