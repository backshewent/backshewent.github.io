They don't call Sharon the butcher of beruit for nothing. The Israeli people elected Sharon Prime Minister, too, which sends a message to Iran how the Israeli people think they should deal with their Arab neighbors. People with little power resort to terrorism because they don't have the ability to go through normal channels. I'm not defending their actions, since I see those actions as both disgusting and self-defeating, but we shouldn't act like they happen in a vacuum or without reason/purpose. <br /><br />Besides, we have also supported the types that have put bombs in buses when it has suited our interests, as has Israel.<br /><br />I should reiterate that I don't like Iran having nukes. I just don't trust Israel with those nukes any more than Iran, except that Israel wouldn't use them against us, while Iran might.</div>

That is, they get paid something that resembles a real salary, and may even receive benefits--at least I did when I was a visiting assistant lecturer. They may have a higher teaching load than an assistant prof, but are not eligible to apply for tenure and make less money. A lecturer would normally have no expectations involving service--they would not have to do committee work, attend any meetings, or advise students. However, it is possible that we're really talking about an adjunct, who generally receives about 2 grand to teach a class and gets no benefits or anything else from the institution. TAs, depending on the institution, have relatively light teaching loads and at a few institutions (Rutgers among them, or at least it used to be) receive health insurance. They also get their tuition covered. They are expected to do lots of extra things, often far more than their contract states--extra grading, picking up laundry, whatever.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What would happen if we unveiled a program that looked like Obamacare, in a place that looked like America, but with competent project management that produced a working website?</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>California is, however, an especially useful test case. First of all, it’s huge: if a system can work for 38 million people, it can work for America as a whole. Also, it’s hard to argue that California has had any special advantages other than that of having a government that actually wants to help the uninsured. When Massachusetts put Romneycare into effect, it already had a relatively low number of uninsured residents. California, however, came into health reform with 22 percent of its nonelderly population uninsured, compared with a national average of 18 percent.<br /><br />Finally, the California authorities have been especially forthcoming with data tracking the progress of enrollment. And the numbers are increasingly encouraging.<br /><br />For one thing, enrollment is surging. At this point, more than 10,000 applications are being completed per day, putting the state well on track to meet its overall targets for 2014 coverage. Just imagine, by the way, how different press coverage would be right now if Obama officials had produced a comparable success, and around 100,000 people a day were signing up nationwide.<br /><br />Equally important is the information on who is enrolling. To work as planned, health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool — that is, it must sign up young, healthy Americans as well as their older, less healthy compatriots. And so far, so good: in October, 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34, slightly above that group’s share of the population.<br /><br />What we have in California, then, is a proof of concept. Yes, Obamacare is workable — in fact, done right, it works just fine.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There won’t be a moment when the clouds suddenly lift, but the exchanges are gradually getting better — a point inadvertently illustrated a few days ago by John Boehner, the speaker of the House. Mr. Boehner staged a publicity stunt in which he tried to sign up on the D.C. health exchange, then triumphantly posted an entry on his blog declaring that he had been unsuccessful. At the bottom of his post, however, is a postscript admitting that the health exchange had called back “a few hours later,” and that he is now enrolled.<br /><br />And maybe the transaction would have proceeded faster if Mr. Boehner’s office hadn’t, according to the D.C. exchange, put its agent — who was calling to help finish the enrollment — on hold for 35 minutes, listening to “lots of patriotic hold music.”</div></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/opinion/krugman-california-here-we-come.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20131125" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">California, Here We Come?</a></div>

The next time Israel plants a bomb in a Tehran cafe, maybe we have something to talk about.  This is not to suggest that Israel is blameless.  While I understand that collateral damage is going to be a part of any conflict, Israel can and should do more to prevent it.  But that is something different than intentionally blowing up a bus of Israeli tourists.  <br /><br />Iran can have nuclear weapons if it wants, the majority of the rest of the world simply won't trade with them as a result.  If your point is that it is wrong for the world powers to impose its will on developing countries, fair point, but this is probably the wrong example on which to take a stand.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I think you need to look at Israel's history in the region a little more closely, particularly the actions of Sharon and Netanyahu. They don't call Sharon the butcher of beruit for nothing. The Israeli people elected Sharon Prime Minister, too, which sends a message to Iran how the Israeli people think they should deal with their Arab neighbors. People with little power resort to terrorism because they don't have the ability to go through normal channels. I'm not defending their actions, since I see those actions as both disgusting and self-defeating, but we shouldn't act like they happen in a vacuum or without reason/purpose. <br /><br />Besides, we have also supported the types that have put bombs in buses when it has suited our interests, as has Israel.<br /><br />I should reiterate that I don't like Iran having nukes. I just don't trust Israel with those nukes any more than Iran, except that Israel wouldn't use them against us, while Iran might.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />By coincidence, we were talking about water resources in my class today and a girl from Palestine chirped in about how things are for her family in friends right now in Palestine. The Israeli government has shut off their electricity and water and people are basically living in a big mess right now. Sewage is filling the streets and people are dying all over the place due to the bad sanitation and lack of clean water. She was particularly upset because she said, &quot;and nobody knows about it.... nobody is doing anything about it.&quot; She was also upset because the UN declared the 19th of November &quot;World Toilet Day.&quot;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1311/S00154/first-un-world-toilet-day-as-gaza-drowns-in-sewage.htm">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1311/S ... sewage.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So, who are the terrorists harming civilians in this scenario?  Ask yourself, if Iran was doing this to Jewish settlers after taking over Jewish lands, how would the world community be reacting to those actions? I'm guessing the reaction would be quite different and it would be all over the news as yet more proof that Iran is full of homicidal maniacs. But Israel gets a pass. Again.</div>

I believe people have a legitimate gripe that it take hours and multiple tries to get signed up; in 2013, that is just ridiculous.  What I think is the bigger issue is the completely baseless linking of the website debacle to the law itself.  When somebody says that the website issues prove that ACA is flawed, they are either obtuse or pandering.  It is a complete red herring and further proof of the utter dysfunction in and outright stream of bullshit that flows out of Washington.  &quot;For the people...&quot;, my ass; unless, of course, you believe the Supreme Court got it right in Citizens United.</div>

I can also perfectly understand why Israel would feel less safe if Iran had the bomb. But that was an interesting strawman.<br /><br />As for your question, Israel has the full backing of the US and many of the Arab states in the region also support or are supported by the US. They are caught between and they have chosen the money or protection over the people of Palestine. Plus, you make it sound ridiculously simple when it's not that at all. All Arabs aren't alike anymore than all Christians are alike. Why were the Protestants and Catholics always at each others' throats? They are the same, they should always work together, right? Nope, also not that simple. Why would an Arab state risk their necks going up against a foe they can't defeat? So, boiled down, I think the answer to your question is a combination of alliances and self preservation and not really caring that much about a group of people who aren't them. <br /><br />The subtext of your message also seems to say that this girl is somehow not being honest. I can say there is literally no other student who I would vouch for over this student.

Beginning at its birth in 1948, the Arabs have vowed to drive the Israelis into the sea.  The Arab nations total approximately 13,500,000 sq. km in size, Iran's size is over 1,600,000 sq. km and Israel is about 20,700 sq. km.  The Arab population living in Arab nations exceeds 366 million, Iran's exceeds 76 million and Israel has a population of around 8 million.  Take a look at this map and ask yourself who should feel most threatened:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.science.co.il/images/maps/Arab-Countries.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>As for your question, Israel has the full backing of the US and many of the Arab states in the region also support or are supported by the US.

My point, however, was (and is) that one thing they do seem to agree upon wholeheartedly is to give their Palestinian brothers as little humanitarian support as possible.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>The subtext of your message also seems to say that this girl is somehow not being honest.

But, since you raised the issue, her claims raise a number of questions.  First, you write:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>She was particularly upset because she said, &quot;and nobody knows about it.... nobody is doing anything about it.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />As to &quot;nobody knowing about it,&quot; do a Google search and you'll see that the issue has been covered extensively by media sources all over the world from electronicintifada.net to Reuters.  Her second point, &quot;nobody is doing anything about it,&quot; is exactly my point about about the lack of assistance from other Arabs.  Gaza was already getting 30% of its electricity from Egypt and local power plants.  What's stopping them from increasing their supply from those sources?<br /><br />The bigger questions in this matter are this:  Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and dismantled Jewish settlements in 2008.  Why exactly is Israel obliged to provide electricity and water to people who lob bombs at them and why can't the Palestinians (with the help of their rich Arab brothers) develop their own infrastructure?<br /><br />You can blame Israel all you want, but the sad fact is that it's more politically convenient for the Palestinians and their Arab brothers to blame Israel than to improve the plight of the Palestinians.</div>

			<div class="content">Come on, JFLNYC. I'm not defending Iran or blaming only Israel. I went out of my way multiple times to point that out.<br /><br />I'm not going to go point for point and work my way through these posts. Suffice to say that I was just trying to say that I can understand why Iran would feel a need to defend itself. If you don't agree with that, then fine. If you think turning off power and water isn't targeting civilians, then we have different definitions of civilians. As I said several times, Israel doesn't need to blow up a bus to commit psychological warfare (terrorism). You can post a map like I'm some kind of idiot, but I should point out that Israel is the one with nuclear capabilities. The Arabs that you lumped all together like they are all one group could have double their current area and it wouldn't keep Israel from blowing them all up if they decided to go nuclear. <br /><br />Should I superimpose a map of the US over your Arab map? I ask because that's what the Arabs see when they look at fighting Israel. They don't see a tiny country, they see a country with nuclear capability that has a huge amount of influence (AIPAC anyone?) with the strongest nation on the planet. If they take a war to Israel, American troops would be on the way before you could yell &quot;La Heim!&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, I have said this many times in the past, but now may be a good time to repeat it. I think they are both at fault and I don't think it will get better because neither side will ever forget the atrocities the other has committed over the decades. I'm annoyed that my tax dollars are lost into that black hole of a region. They can hate each other to death and leave us out of it. <br /><br />As for the girl, she probably isn't hearing about it in school or from her friends, and I doubt she scours the internet looking for stuff. She talks to her family and sees it firsthand on holidays. I shouldn't have dragged her into it. You can find it if you look for it, but it isn;t blasted in your face like the things that Iran or other Arab countries do. Also, pretty much every link I saw about it was the same article picked up by multiple websites. So it isn't all over the place.<br /><br />And why do you keep bringing up this completely unrelated point of humanitarian aid from other Arab countries? How is that related to whether or not Iran should feel safe or has a right to defend itself? Even if what you say is true about Arabs not helping Palestine to make Israel look bad, what does that have to do with the conversation? Are you saying that the thing you said is plastered all over the internet isn't happening? If it is happening, then isn't that evidence that Israel is acting badly?</div>
