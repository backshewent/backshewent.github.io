Matt Taibbi among others showed pretty conclusively that this was one of the more extreme examples of regulatory capture you will ever see. Post Glass-Steagall repeal--for which, yes, I do blame the Clintons and the neoliberals--the vicious exploitation of low-information consumers and obscene profit-taking was probably more the point than an unintended consequence of Barney Frank's do-goodery.</div>

			<div class="content">I had a longer response, but probably just best to link and clip from the (long) article. Emphases mine. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/13/no-marco-rubio-government-did-not-cause-the-housing-crisis/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">No, Government Didn't Cause the Housing Crisis</a><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. Private markets, rather than the GSEs, created the subprime mortgage boom.<br /><br />The subprime mortgage boom and the subsequent crash are very much concentrated in the private market, not the public market. Subprime is a creature of the private label securitization channel (PLS) market, instead of the Government-Sponsored Entities (GSEs, or Fannie and Freddie). The fly-by-night lending boom, slicing and dicing mortgage bonds, derivatives and CDOs, and all the other shadiness of the mortgage market in the 2000s were Wall Street creations, and they drove all those risky mortgages.<br /><br />Here's some data to back that up: &quot;More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions... Private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year.&quot;<br /><br />As University of California, Irvine law professor David Min has argued, saying the government directly created either the housing bubble or subprime loans has a serious problem with the timing. &quot;From 2002-2005, [GSEs] saw a fairly precipitous drop in market share, going from about 50 percent to just under 30 percent of all mortgage originations. Conversely, private label securitization [PLS] shot up from about 10 percent to about 40 percent over the same period. This is, to state the obvious, a very radical shift in mortgage originations that overlapped neatly with the origination of the most toxic home loans.&quot;<br />…<br />2. The Community Reinvestment Act and the GSE's affordability mission didn't cause the crisis.<br /><br />Many conservatives argue that the &quot;affordability goals&quot; of the GSEs, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was created in the 1970s to make sure poor communities had access to credit, either directly or indirectly led to subprime loans.<br /><br />Research from the Federal Reserve by Neil Bhutta and Glenn B. Canner (helpfully summarized in this Randy Kroszner speech), argues that the CRA couldn't have been behind the subprime and housing bubbles. &quot;The very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis.&quot; Only six percent of higher-priced loans (their proxy for subprime loans) were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or CRA neighborhoods.<br /><br />A recent paper found that while the CRA might have introduced slightly larger risks in lending portfolios, extra loans done to meet CRA compliance weren't more likely to have higher interest rates, lower loan-to-value, or be balloon/interest-only/jumbo/buy-down mortgages, or hold other subprime characteristics. So it is unlikely that the CRA was priming the pump for subprime, or subtly encouraging subprime mortgages to be made by private lenders.<br /><br />Jason Thomas and Robert Van Order's research argues that subprime loans were only 5 percent of the GSEs' losses. The GSEs' affordability mission led them to buy the highly rated tranches of mortgage bonds, for which there was already a ton of demand and were not essential to the completion of the deals.<br />…<br />4. Conservatives arguments tend to blur the definition of subprime. Some, such as Ed Pinto of AEI, argue that the GSEs had huge subprime exposure if you create a new category that represents the risks of subprime more accurately. He created a new &quot;high risk&quot; category, which he then argues these high-risk loans were held by the GSEs. This argument blur categories together and obscures more than it reveals. …<br /> …<br />The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) panel looked carefully at this argument and also ended up finding it doesn't work. So those who blame the GSEs can't get the numbers to work when they make up categories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">(Fun fact: These same conservatives sang a different tune before the crash. They argued that the CRA and the GSEs were getting in the way of getting risky subprime mortgages to risky subprime borrowers. See Should CRA Stand for 'Community Redundancy Act? from Cato in 2000 or AEI's Peter Wallison in 2004 arguing &quot;study after study has shown that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are failing to do even as much as banks and S&Ls in providing financing for affordable housing, including minority and low income housing.&quot;)</span><br /><br />5. The government policy that likely made an impact were deregulatory actions.<br /><br />In 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which deregulated the derivatives market, in a lame duck session as a rider to an 11,000 page omnibus appropriation bill. A banking capital &quot;recourse rule&quot; in 2001 allowed the ratings agencies and private bank risk modelers to decide what banks should hold against risk. In 2003 the OCC preempted and overruled Georgia’s new anti-predatory lending laws. <span style="font-weight: bold">Alan Greenspan refused to enforce regulations on, or even investigate the wrongdoing of, the new subprime market during the 2000s. The 2005 bankruptcy reforms in BAPCPA, widely viewed as friendly if not written by the financial industry, codified the market practice of letting derivatives go to the front of the line in bankruptcy, helping create the conditions for shadow banking runs.</span><br /><br />These government actions all fall under the rubric of deregulation, or &quot;letting the market decide&quot; how to manage the rules of the financial sector, and they are more relevant to the actual crisis. Though these are government policies, and they were reckless, I doubt they are what conservatives like Rubio mean.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The missing #3 is probably worth copying in full: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>3.

Boring, but thorough:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wallison’s conclusion that federal affordable housing policies are primarily responsible for the financial crisis is based entirely on the research conclusions of Pinto, who finds that there are 27 million “subprime” or “high-risk” loans outstanding, with approximately 19.25 million of these attributable to the federal government’s affordable housing policies. As I point out in “Faulty Conclusions,” Pinto only gets to these numbers (which are radically divergent from all other estimates—for example, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates that there are only 4.59 million high-risk loans outstanding) by making a series of very problematic and unjustified assumptions.<br /><br />Case in point: To support his claim that the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires regulated banks and thrifts to provide credit nondiscriminatorily to low- and moderate-income borrowers, caused the origination of 2.24 million outstanding “high-risk” mortgages, Pinto includes many loans originated by lenders who were not even subject to CRA. In fact, most of the “high-risk” loans Pinto attributes to CRA were not eligible for CRA credit.<br /><br />Similarly, in arguing that Fannie and Freddie’s affordable housing goals caused the origination of 12 million “subprime” and equivalently “high-risk” loans, Pinto includes millions of loans that would not typically qualify for those goals. In fact, the vast majority (65 percent) of the “high-risk” loans Pinto attributes to the affordable housing goals of Fannie and Freddie fall into this category.</div></blockquote></div>

Conversely, private label securitization [PLS] shot up from about 10 percent to about 40 percent over the same period. This is, to state the obvious, a very radical shift in mortgage originations that overlapped neatly with the origination of the most toxic home loans.&quot;<br />…<br />2. The Community Reinvestment Act and the GSE's affordability mission didn't cause the crisis.<br /><br />Many conservatives argue that the &quot;affordability goals&quot; of the GSEs, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was created in the 1970s to make sure poor communities had access to credit, either directly or indirectly led to subprime loans.<br /><br />Research from the Federal Reserve by Neil Bhutta and Glenn B. Canner (helpfully summarized in this Randy Kroszner speech), argues that the CRA couldn't have been behind the subprime and housing bubbles. &quot;The very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis.&quot; Only six percent of higher-priced loans (their proxy for subprime loans) were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or CRA neighborhoods.<br /><br />A recent paper found that while the CRA might have introduced slightly larger risks in lending portfolios, extra loans done to meet CRA compliance weren't more likely to have higher interest rates, lower loan-to-value, or be balloon/interest-only/jumbo/buy-down mortgages, or hold other subprime characteristics. So it is unlikely that the CRA was priming the pump for subprime, or subtly encouraging subprime mortgages to be made by private lenders.<br /><br />Jason Thomas and Robert Van Order's research argues that subprime loans were only 5 percent of the GSEs' losses. The GSEs' affordability mission led them to buy the highly rated tranches of mortgage bonds, for which there was already a ton of demand and were not essential to the completion of the deals.<br />…<br />4. Conservatives arguments tend to blur the definition of subprime. Some, such as Ed Pinto of AEI, argue that the GSEs had huge subprime exposure if you create a new category that represents the risks of subprime more accurately. He created a new &quot;high risk&quot; category, which he then argues these high-risk loans were held by the GSEs. This argument blur categories together and obscures more than it reveals. …<br /> …<br />The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) panel looked carefully at this argument and also ended up finding it doesn't work. So those who blame the GSEs can't get the numbers to work when they make up categories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">(Fun fact: These same conservatives sang a different tune before the crash. They argued that the CRA and the GSEs were getting in the way of getting risky subprime mortgages to risky subprime borrowers. See Should CRA Stand for 'Community Redundancy Act? from Cato in 2000 or AEI's Peter Wallison in 2004 arguing &quot;study after study has shown that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are failing to do even as much as banks and S&Ls in providing financing for affordable housing, including minority and low income housing.&quot;)</span><br /><br />5. The government policy that likely made an impact were deregulatory actions.<br /><br />In 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which deregulated the derivatives market, in a lame duck session as a rider to an 11,000 page omnibus appropriation bill. A banking capital &quot;recourse rule&quot; in 2001 allowed the ratings agencies and private bank risk modelers to decide what banks should hold against risk. In 2003 the OCC preempted and overruled Georgia’s new anti-predatory lending laws. <span style="font-weight: bold">Alan Greenspan refused to enforce regulations on, or even investigate the wrongdoing of, the new subprime market during the 2000s. The 2005 bankruptcy reforms in BAPCPA, widely viewed as friendly if not written by the financial industry, codified the market practice of letting derivatives go to the front of the line in bankruptcy, helping create the conditions for shadow banking runs.</span><br /><br />These government actions all fall under the rubric of deregulation, or &quot;letting the market decide&quot; how to manage the rules of the financial sector, and they are more relevant to the actual crisis. Though these are government policies, and they were reckless, I doubt they are what conservatives like Rubio mean.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The missing #3 is probably worth copying in full: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>3.

Boring, but thorough:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Wallison’s conclusion that federal affordable housing policies are primarily responsible for the financial crisis is based entirely on the research conclusions of Pinto, who finds that there are 27 million “subprime” or “high-risk” loans outstanding, with approximately 19.25 million of these attributable to the federal government’s affordable housing policies. As I point out in “Faulty Conclusions,” Pinto only gets to these numbers (which are radically divergent from all other estimates—for example, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates that there are only 4.59 million high-risk loans outstanding) by making a series of very problematic and unjustified assumptions.<br /><br />Case in point: To support his claim that the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires regulated banks and thrifts to provide credit nondiscriminatorily to low- and moderate-income borrowers, caused the origination of 2.24 million outstanding “high-risk” mortgages, Pinto includes many loans originated by lenders who were not even subject to CRA. In fact, most of the “high-risk” loans Pinto attributes to CRA were not eligible for CRA credit.<br /><br />Similarly, in arguing that Fannie and Freddie’s affordable housing goals caused the origination of 12 million “subprime” and equivalently “high-risk” loans, Pinto includes millions of loans that would not typically qualify for those goals. In fact, the vast majority (65 percent) of the “high-risk” loans Pinto attributes to the affordable housing goals of Fannie and Freddie fall into this category.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br /><br />Thanks for digging that up and parsing.<br /><br />It's not a terrible argument - but it does not exculpate Carter, CRA, Congress, Fannie, Freddie, Bush, or Barney Frank.  The volume of bad loans directly attributable to CRA is not really important - because the rules changed.<br /><br />My view is that a change in government policy was the root cause.  When the volume of bad loans was small AND housing prices were rising, just peachy. But the government changed the rules of the game. Private lenders were both encouraged and backstopped in making imprudent loans. Were they greedy and reckless? Yes indeed. But absent the government push for this type of business, the meltdown never happens.  Even so, it probably did require a perfect storm of bad policy, artificially low interest rates, reckless lenders, and insipid borrowers.<br /><br />The comments section for any piece like that is full of the usual idiocy, but there are some good ones worth considering.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>So the liberal commentary is now that the Community Reinvestment Act did not force banks to lower underwriting standards that increased the number of subprime loans. Hogwash <br />The exclusion of profits on sales of residential real estate from capital gains taxation in 1996 did not spark a speculative stampede in the housing market didn't feed the bubble. Nonsense.  <br />The artificially low interest rates of the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan didn't fuel the speculative explosion in the real estate market. Of course it did. It was pouring gas on the fire.  <br />The refusal of Greenspan, Rubin and Summers.to regulate derivatives despite the repeated warnings of Brooksley Born didn't create a mountain of risk undetected by regulators on either side of the Atlantic wasn't government's fault. Pure delusion.  <br />And the straw that broke the camel's back, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgages to clear the books of private lenders so they could write hundreds of billions of dollars of more mortgages didn't create a powder keg ready to explode. Insanity. </div></blockquote></div>
