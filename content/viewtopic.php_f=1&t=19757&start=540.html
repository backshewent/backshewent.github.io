			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>CFP wrote:</cite>Where did anyone say that robot umpires were immediately becoming part of baseball and human umpires were being removed as of this spring training? Calm down man, Jesus Christ</div></blockquote><br /><br />iirc, the relevance for the phillies this season is that any significant change in realmuto's pitch framing value in 2021 or 2022 contributes to determining how much the phillies should offer to pay him during the crucial contract negotiations they will be having with him over the coming months.   knowing how much positive or negative pitch framing value he now has is needed to figure out how much defensive he is likely to gain or lose relative to other catchers and other position players.<br /><br />unfortunately, as i said earlier, for jtr in particular that's next to impossible.   his numbers have been all over the place, and the 2019-2020 change has a half-dozen plausible explanations thanks to his change in teams and all sorts of changes to the game in general.   that's why, for me, the important thing about jtr is that his arm and legs make given him plenty of value on offense and defense that few if any other catchers have.</div>

			<div class="content">I just looked just at the 30 catchers that had 300 PA or more, so &quot;starting catchers&quot;, and compared their WAR from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/wKdXy" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">bbref</a> and <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=300&type=8&season=2019&month=0&season1=2019&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&startdate=2019-01-01&enddate=2019-12-31&sort=21,d" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">fangraphs</a> (bWAR and fWAR).  It's interesting because they use very different methods for valuing defense - fWAR does NOT measure/include pitch framing in their values, and bWAR DOES include it:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>bbref wrote:</cite>Rdef. Fielding Runs<br />Fielding Runs: Defensive Runs Saved<br />Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) is the most sophisticated public system available. It includes 8 factors:<br /><br />Fielding Range Plus/Minus Runs Saved based on BIS-trained scorer observations and batted ball timing to determine the velocity of each batted ball.<br />Outfield arm runs saved based on exact counts of baserunner advancements and kills and the velocity of the hit ball.<br />Infielder double plays based on opportunities and rates they were turned based also on batted ball velocity.<br />Good play-bad play values which include 28 positive play types. For example: HR-saving catches, backing up a play, blocking a pitch in the dirt, and 54 misplays like missing the cutoff man, failing to anticipate the wall and allowing extra bases, not covering a base, pulling a foot off the bag, etc...<br />Bunt Fielding<br />Catcher SB/CS data (which is tweaked by the pitchers caught)<br />Pitcher SB/CS data (which is tweaked by the catchers behind the plate)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Catcher handling of the pitching staff via things like pitch framing and pitch calling</span></div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>fangraphs wrote:</cite>For catchers we use the Stolen Base Runs (rSB) aspect of Defensive Runs Saved and Runs Saved on Passed Pitches (RPP) because there is no UZR for catchers. <span style="font-weight: bold">We currently do not include framing runs in WAR for catchers</span>, and catcher defense is admittedly the most difficult to measure in general.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Taking all that in, we would assume that the BEST pitch-framing catchers would have the biggest fWAR/bWAR discrepancies, because bWAR would include that magical ability, and fWAR ignores it.  Offense isn't that hard to measure, so they'll be close to equal there.<br /><br />What's weird is that the EXACT OPPOSITE is occurring.  The 3 catchers with the biggest WAR differences are Yasmani Grandal (2.7 WAR diff), Tyler Flowers (2.2), and Austin Hedges (2.0).  The 3 catchers that were <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/catcher_framing" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2019's best pitch framers</a> (by runs saved) are... Austin Hedges, Tyler Flowers, and Yasmani Grandal.  Same 3 guys.   But all three of them are rated SIGNIFICANTLY better defensively by fangraphs than by bbref, the place that INCLUDES framing in its values.<br /><br />The only logical conclusion, to me, is that the metric that attempts to include all aspects of catcher defense (SB/PB/framing/bunts), and is event driven (good/bad play, extra-bases taken, etc), finds that pitch framing value is dwarfed by the value of other aspects of catching defense.<br /><br />A lot to digest and TLDR and all that, but it's right there:  the best pitch-framers are poorly rated overall defensively by the metric that includes pitch-framing.  For Flowers, it's -6 runs for bbref, +19 for fangraphs; for Grandal it's -11 and +21; and for Hedges, it's +4 and +27.   In all cases, bbref ranks them at least 20 runs worse than fangraphs, using DRS, which includes framing.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Shore wrote:</cite>I just looked just at the 30 catchers that had 300 PA or more, so &quot;starting catchers&quot;, and compared their WAR from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/wKdXy" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">bbref</a> and <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=300&type=8&season=2019&month=0&season1=2019&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&startdate=2019-01-01&enddate=2019-12-31&sort=21,d" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">fangraphs</a> (bWAR and fWAR).  It's interesting because they use very different methods for valuing defense - fWAR does NOT measure/include pitch framing in their values, and bWAR DOES include it:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>bbref wrote:</cite>Rdef. Fielding Runs<br />Fielding Runs: Defensive Runs Saved<br />Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) is the most sophisticated public system available. It includes 8 factors:<br /><br />Fielding Range Plus/Minus Runs Saved based on BIS-trained scorer observations and batted ball timing to determine the velocity of each batted ball.<br />Outfield arm runs saved based on exact counts of baserunner advancements and kills and the velocity of the hit ball.<br />Infielder double plays based on opportunities and rates they were turned based also on batted ball velocity.<br />Good play-bad play values which include 28 positive play types. For example: HR-saving catches, backing up a play, blocking a pitch in the dirt, and 54 misplays like missing the cutoff man, failing to anticipate the wall and allowing extra bases, not covering a base, pulling a foot off the bag, etc...<br />Bunt Fielding<br />Catcher SB/CS data (which is tweaked by the pitchers caught)<br />Pitcher SB/CS data (which is tweaked by the catchers behind the plate)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Catcher handling of the pitching staff via things like pitch framing and pitch calling</span></div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>fangraphs wrote:</cite>For catchers we use the Stolen Base Runs (rSB) aspect of Defensive Runs Saved and Runs Saved on Passed Pitches (RPP) because there is no UZR for catchers. <span style="font-weight: bold">We currently do not include framing runs in WAR for catchers</span>, and catcher defense is admittedly the most difficult to measure in general.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Taking all that in, we would assume that the BEST pitch-framing catchers would have the biggest fWAR/bWAR discrepancies, because bWAR would include that magical ability, and fWAR ignores it.  Offense isn't that hard to measure, so they'll be close to equal there.<br /><br />What's weird is that the EXACT OPPOSITE is occurring.  The 3 catchers with the biggest WAR differences are Yasmani Grandal (2.7 WAR diff), Tyler Flowers (2.2), and Austin Hedges (2.0).  The 3 catchers that were <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/catcher_framing" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2019's best pitch framers</a> (by runs saved) are... Austin Hedges, Tyler Flowers, and Yasmani Grandal.  Same 3 guys.   But all three of them are rated SIGNIFICANTLY better defensively by fangraphs than by bbref, the place that INCLUDES framing in its values.<br /><br />The only logical conclusion, to me, is that the metric that attempts to include all aspects of catcher defense (SB/PB/framing/bunts), and is event driven (good/bad play, extra-bases taken, etc), finds that pitch framing value is dwarfed by the value of other aspects of catching defense.<br /><br />A lot to digest and TLDR and all that, but it's right there:  the best pitch-framers are poorly rated overall defensively by the metric that includes pitch-framing.  For Flowers, it's -6 runs for bbref, +19 for fangraphs; for Grandal it's -11 and +21; and for Hedges, it's +4 and +27.   In all cases, bbref ranks them at least 20 runs worse than fangraphs, using DRS, which includes framing.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is all great and useful data for what is happening today. And your assumptions and logical conclusions all make sense to me based on what's happening today. My point all along is that everything changes when MLB institutes a robo-ump. These stats basically all go out the window and we need to start over.<br /><br />A catchers job today is basically that of an optical illusionist. They're expected to have perfect positioning to block the umps view while simultaneously snatching the ball out of the air and moving it 2&quot; to the right/left/up/down. And the expectations are different on every single pitch. This is the reason so many balls get past Gary Sanchez. Its not because he's incapable of blacking the ball. Its because he's trying to do all of these other things WHILE blocking the ball. Now his job simply becomes catch and throw.<br /><br />Lets start over with a simple question. What do you think happens to the overall offensive production from the catcher position as a result of MLB instituting robo-umps?<br /><br />1. There will be no change.<br />2. There will be a slight, but barely noticeable increase.<br />3. There will be a notable, but not significant increase in offense.<br />4. There will be a significant increase.<br /><br />I obviously believe it will be #4. <br /><br />I expect within 5 years of institution, the catcher production will be more in line with that of a 3B/CI rather than less than a SS/CF as it is today.</div>

Why did Tyler Flowers, one of the best pitch framers who had 2.1 fWAR in 85 games, sign for only 1 year $4 million?   The same year Travis D'arnaud signs for $16 million...  Either all 30 teams with their hordes of ivy league analytic guys are undervaluing pitch framing, or the guy doing this stuff for free for Fangraphs (and WhiteyFan) are overvaluing it.  My hunch says it's the latter.</div>

The rest of it - catching, throwing, insanity, calling games, blocking pitches, etc. - explains how relatively poor hitters can make the majors - they can do the things necessary to be a catcher.<br /><br />FWIW, the positions over the last 50 years, per bbref team batting by position splits:<br /><br />1B:  .800<br />RF:  .780<br />LF:  .772<br />DH:  .763<br />3B:  .748<br />CF:  .742<br />2B:  .707<br />C:   .701<br />SS:  .681</div></blockquote><br /><br />Hey look, it's the defensive spectrum!</div>

What do you think happens to the overall offensive production from the catcher position as a result of MLB instituting robo-umps?<br /><br />1. There will be no change.<br />2.

There will be a significant increase.<br /><br />I obviously believe it will be #4. <br /><br />I expect within 5 years of institution, the catcher production will be more in line with that of a 3B/CI rather than less than a SS/CF as it is today.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I believe the answer is 1 or 2, but demonstrably not 4.<br /><br />First of all, we have no metrics that show that the best pitch framers are the most valuable defenders, but we have at least one metric that shows the opposite.  Second, most importantly, is that catchers have never hit like that.  If we go back 50 years worth of data, 1970-2019, before &quot;pitch framing&quot; was the cat's meow, catchers are the 2nd-worst hitting position, after SS.  2B is a little better, and everywhere else is significantly better.

That's how much I think it will change things. I believe the catcher position will be forever discussed as the &quot;pre-robo-ump&quot; and &quot;post-robo-ump&quot; eras. Obliviously some (most?) of you don't agree. That's ok. Will be interesting to track.<br /><br />Thanks again for digging up the info and giving your opinion. I do appreciate it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but wouldn't catcher valuations revert to what they were before pitch framing was tracked?</div>

			<div class="content">Guys, I found a really awesome article that I know you're going to want to read.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br /><a href="https://www.crawfishboxes.com/2019/11/19/20960632/out-of-the-frame-the-effect-of-an-electronic-strike-zone-on-catching-framing-robo-umps-robot-umpires" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Out of the Frame: The Effect of an Electronic Strike Zone on Catching</a><br /><br />Some of the highlights:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The magnitude of impact of having a good framing catcher as opposed to a bad framing catcher was on the same order of magnitude as the impact of having a good hitting catcher as opposed to a bad hitting one.<br /><br />Catcher is considered the most defensive-oriented position in the game. The catcher’s defensive skills: framing, throwing and blocking, constitute nearly half (45.8%) the above pie graph. Most of that half (31.3%) comes from framing.<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oPU7Fi_0zaICfgw62ahgf2L5VUE=/0x0:728x409/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:728x409):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19367669/2019_EOS_bppie.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />When electronic strike zones are implemented, Framing’s 31.3% portion of the pie will drop to zero. With the elimination of framing, the new distribution of the relative impacts of catcher skills looks like this:<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDABDpQyK4nawkWdsqlc2IB4VFQ=/0x0:728x409/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:728x409):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19368393/pie_with_ESR.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Getting rid of framing makes the entire pool of catchers more homogenous. </span> (this is really the most important point of everything Im saying)<br /><br />Catcher is now a more offensive position.<br /><br />A well-implemented electronic strike zone may be good for the sport, but it does diminish the role of the catcher by taking away potential defensive value.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />As great as this info is, I still consider it somewhat flawed. They're assuming these defensive skills are unrelated and basically operate in a vacuum. In their model, they take away &quot;pitch framing&quot; and assume that &quot;throwing&quot; and &quot;blocking&quot; are still the same difficult skills they were before. But this is incorrect. Once you take away pitch framing (and the need to always be in the absolute perfect position), throwing and blocking become basic skills that practically any competent MLB player can handle. <br /><br />In the article, they make the analogy that taking away pitch framing would be like &quot;all NFL QB's magically having the same arm strength&quot; or &quot;all NBA centers magically having the same FT percentage&quot;. While it helps drive home how important they feel this skill is, I still don't like the analogies. I think a better comparison would be... &quot;From now on, all flyballs will be hit directly at the Outfielder AND all ground balls will be hit directly at the infielder&quot;. Pretty much all outfielders can catch flyballs that are hit right at them and pretty much all infielders can field ground balls that are hit right to them. The thing that separates the good from the elite is their range. A better analogy would be that taking away pitch framing from catchers is like taking away range from an IF/OF, IMO. <br /><br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the article (or at least the part that made me feel like I wasnt completely losing my mind) was that MLB not only recognizes that this is going to be a problem, but already seems to be taking some steps to &quot;fix&quot; the problem they are creating.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>This past year, MLB asked the Atlantic League to implement a curious rule of allowing a batter to try to advance to first base on any pitch that gets past the catcher, whether it be a wild pitch or a passed ball. Although it is informally known as “stealing first base,” it is really more akin to the scenario of reaching first base safely on a dropped third strike. The difference is that now it doesn’t have to be strike three to happen.<br /><br />It seemed a bizarre experimental rule, deviating more from traditional baseball rules than any of the other experimental rules. Joe Sheehan in his newsletter proposed one possible reason this rule was included: by creating more blocking chances, you add some defensive value back to the catcher that was lost with the elimination of framing:</div></blockquote><br /><br />Again, I feel this is flawed thinking. Blocking balls in the dirt is a difficult skill when you are also trying to frame the ptich. Once you no longer have to worry with framing, blocking a ball in the dirt becomes about as routine as a flyball that is hit right to you or a grounder that is hit right at you. I stand by my theory that big changes are coming at the catcher position.</div>
