			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>pacino wrote:</cite>glenn greenwald appears upset at obama and the DOJ for things they didnt do in this case, regarding Miranda rights. they didnt roll anything back here, nor did they abuse anything, but he's still ranting and raving in his columns. </div></blockquote><br /><br />I presume both he and ACLU are concerned that if the decision to question without informing a suspect of their rights continues to be used, you get closer to a situation where you're happy to arrrest people and question them without charge, solely on the basis of 'perceived threat to public safety'.  <br /><br />That is a bad habit to get into.  No, the US Govt aren't rolling anything back, but you are exploiting an existing legal judgement, reapplying it to a different situation and in the process curtailing civil liberties. Greenwald and the ACLU are right to make noise about it.  Arresting, questioning and holding without charge are not good things to do. Furthermore, they don't help the fight against committed terrorism. For example, see the UK government's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Terrorism_Acts" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a>  which allowed suspects to be detained for up to 7 days without charge if the police decided it was fair. These acts, which were put in place in 1974, resulted in a series of false imprisonments which didn't get corrected till at least 10 years later (most famously, Gerry Conlon and the other 'suspects' in the Guildford pub bombings as made famous in In the Name of the Father). <br /><br />All you get when you lock down those civil liberties is more suspicion of the authorities, and more recruitment to terorrist causes. PTA was up there with Bloody Sunday for IRA recruitment. <br /><br />America remains an ethnically diverse nation.  Anything you do to encourage the communities within that nation to suspect the authorities of targeting them makes America a shittier, more suspicious place to be.</div>

That is bad stuff right there. <br /><br />It expands on the existing grounds for questioning someone on the basis of determining if there are any immediate threats to public safety to include questioning about general intelligence matters, depending on whether the FBI or DOJ think it's appropriate. <br /><br />Sounds awfully like interrogation and detention without charge to me.  Were I an American citizen, I would be lobbying hard to prevent the government from having that power.</div>

You either have faith in your justice system  or you don't, and if you start casting it out when things are really, really important then you're headed down a slippery slope. If you think the suspect has too many rights, well, revisit the issue and cast it into law. Equal protection means equal protection, it's pretty clear. And whether or not you &quot;Mirandize&quot; someone shouldn't mean a hoot, you have these rights or you don't, or they aren't actually rights. I hope every citizen knows them and can invoke them- I trust most do and knows they don't have to be called into being by pronouncing magic words or can disappear as long as the imp's name remains a secret.That's not to say THIS suspect was mistreated in any way, and the assertions of extra-judicial interrogation may have been in fact more political appeasement then any necessary or even out of the ordinary measures. But the fact that this appeasement works and that it's almost unanimous that some sort of treatment outside the law was necessary in this case is frightening in itself, since it speaks to a basic distrust of our legal institutions. And if it becomes accepted (or more accepted, since it already is by many) it will certainly result in innocent people being caught up, as well as engendering a disrespect for constitutional procedures that will inevitably corrupt a case and let the guilty go free.</div>

			<div class="content">I know it's not a popular opinion but maybe it's time we reevaluate our position on the world stage and actually delve into and have a discussion on why individuals feel the need to sacrifice their lives in order to inflict casualties on our soil. The suspect in custody said the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was a prime motivation in being radicalized. OBL cited America stationing troops in their Holy Land. The witness from Yemen testified on Capitol Hill that the indiscriminate drone strikes are terrifying people and causing resentment in the region. The arrogance we portray to the rest of the world is heinous, and there's nothing wrong with listening to the reasons of why these people are becoming so militant. Instead, we scream and chant USA and act like our shit don't stink.</div>

			<div class="content">Agreed, but we don't exactly help our own cause either. Unless we want to fight a perpetual War on Terror we should do everything we can to mitigate our chances of being attacked. Invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 based on scant evidence and an expansion of our drone war haven't exactly hurt Al-qaedas ability to recruit.</div>

			<div class="content">Jerz, utimately are you happy that the police can detain and interrogate suspects without  charge and granting the suspects any rights? because as far as I can tell that's what you've had since 2010. <br /><br />Outside of the principle of upholding the essential rights of anyone living in america, to me it's dangerous because a) police should not have that de jure power (they usually find a de facto way to get it but that at least can be legally contested) and b) it breeds suspicion and hostility in the affected communities. If you want islamic americans to assist you with intelligence, apprehending and interrogating their sons and daughters without charge will not help your goal.</div>
