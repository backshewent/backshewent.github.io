<br />
<br />I'm all for that bill passing, but that is absolutely the dumbest stat I've ever read.  What's the average age of first responders?  What's the average of first responders who die generally?  Since they need to still be working, it's probably not much higher than 48</div>

<br />
<br />Mostly I'm suggesting that if you drop hedge funders, etc out of the college+ categories, it has a greater effect on average reported incomes than dropping the really well-paid plumbers out of the primary-ed only category.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure the occasional misfit (college dropout Gates, etc) would greatly offset the effect I've suggested.</div>

<br />
<br />On the other hand, plenty of people who've done very well at college have conspired  to cause cataclysmic messes the consequences of which all of us have the displeasure of living with. 
<br />
<br />I doubt they were really &quot;cut out for college&quot;, inasmuch as their reasons for being there were to make the connections and practice the habits that would gain them the opportunities to cause those cataclysmic meses, rather than, say, to absorb Pliny & Ovid.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't trust them to clean my pool either.</div>

			<div class="content">I want to, and will, bore some of you to tears and piss off others of you by talking about education and the economy in a minute. But first, from the article doc linked to above... 
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Mr. Mangano is pleading for more time, publicly saying he was personally negotiating with the unions for significant savings. Privately, he has been lobbying state lawmakers to let him raise the countyâ€™s sales tax by a quarter of a percent, which would generate about $60 million. Getting the sales tax increase, union leaders said in interviews, was a precondition for them to make concessions.<br /><br />Moodyâ€™s, the bond-rating agency, is not waiting. On Nov. 4, it downgraded the countyâ€™s debt, citing $158 million in risks and weakening liquidity, and warning that even Mr. Manganoâ€™s contingency plans required contingency plans.<br /><br />This week, the situation grew more dire. Before heading to Disney World on Wednesday for a three-day golf outing and a fund-raiser, Mr. Mangano went to Albany, where he discovered what others said had been obvious: There would be no state assistance for Nassau now.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The hint here? The sales tax, which is the most regressive one. Future historians are going to debate endlessly whether the 'baggers' true defining quality is their dickishness or idiocy. 
<br />
<br />The last graf here at least offers a laff through the wince.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>More interesting graphs (posted by Rich Lowery *HISSSS* at National Review)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nfs/uploaded/u2500/rich_chart_20101210a.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think conservatives need to spend more time thinking about all of this, and what our solutionsâ€“if anyâ€“are to it.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />So first of all, good on Lowry for what Vox quotes here. I think the &quot;problem&quot; is basically how to raise educational attainment so that even if the trend persists or sharpens further (and it will), it matters less in terms of equity, growth and international competition because more people are at the top couple lines. I don't know how you do this while hating on the public sector as that tribe constantly does, but I'd love to hear some ideas. 
<br />
<br />The thing itself: I've seen numbers on how people at different education levels contribute to/take from the public coffers, and the one I remember is that the difference over the course of an average working lifetime between not finishing high school and finishing high school is a swing of something like $327,000--from being a net &quot;loss&quot; of $140k or so to contributing about $190k. It goes up from there, to the point where college graduates are net contributors to public budgets above a million dollars. One way to think about this is that the stuff we edumacated types tend to &quot;use&quot;--roads, uniformed services, etc--are fairly inexpensive; the stuff the less educated tend to use--incarceration, homeless shelters, etc--are fairly costly. 
<br />
<br />The other point, obviously relevant these days, is the differentiation of unemployment rates by educational attainment. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat7.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Here's the BLS page</a> showing average jobless rates by schooling in 2009. As you rise in educational attainment, the employment-to-population ratio goes up and the unemployment rate goes down. This is a big deal even before you figure the &quot;education premium&quot; which Lowry via Vox features in the graph. 
<br />
<br />About Wiz and his plumber: at least in the US, you probably can't do that job without post-secondary education. Union apprenticeship slots--not the only way to become a plumber, but the best--are extremely competitive, and much more equitably awarded than was the case twenty years ago. You finish high school, you do well, and then your apprenticeship essentially substitutes for college education. 
<br />
<br />Which is the real takeaway. The goal shouldn't be to get everyone a four-year college degree, but in the post-industrial economy, with private-sector unionization all but dead and buried, the odds of reaching economic self-sufficiency without something beyond a high school degree are almost zero. Whether it's industry-recognized certification (and probably more than one), an AA, or that BA/BS, you need something. What we as a society must move toward is the idea that four-year college isn't for everybody, as a matter of ability and inclination, but post-secondary education most definitely is.</div>

<br />Not if you can see teh future!
<br />
<br />He meant the average age of death of those to suffer the consequence of death after 9/11, with the exclusion of those who have perished during 9/11 or encountered a premature death non-related to the aftermath of 9/11.
<br />
<br />The post-9/11 GZ responder death count as of Nov 2010 is 916.  Most from respirtory conditions and blood cell cancers.
<br />
<br />There's a big uptick in malignant mesothelioma (a rare form of cancer usually caused by asbestos exposure) and blood cell cancers in first responders and recovery workers.  IIRC, the first 30-some floors of the WTC towers had asbestos fireproofing sprayed on the steel.
<br />
<br />The first responder illness rate since 9/11 is around 70%
<br />
<br />An April 2010 study of 5000 rescue workers, all the workers studied had impaired lung functions and 20% are on permanent respiratory disability.
<br />
<br />
<br />IOW, these peeps got dealt a crappy hand.</div>

			<div class="content">Well there you go, that's a weird congruence right there.  Positively non-euclidean, I'd say.  It's not everyday that dajafi, me and vox all agree on something of an economic nature.
<br />
<br />I'd be curious to know your thoughts on the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_42/b4151033735128.htm" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">german apprenticeship system</a>(that article is a brief overview, but you'd want to do some more in depth reading than that), which gets a lot of chat over here these days, or indeed anytime people are fretting about too many students.  Not to put it down.  I think there's something too it.  doubly so when I read that approximately 70% of germany's employment is provided by small to medium businesses, 
<br />
<br />But I'd also like to put forward a premise, with minimal founding in actual fact.  First, a brief bit of context. At the start of blair's new labour government, they set great store by meritocracy, and a large amount of time and money was put into getting more people into college under Labour's time in power.  There's boring cultural snobbish stuff hanging round there which was probably added impetus for this. It was surprising that it was whole-heartedly taken up, given the costs attached, especially compared to ireland where they passed an act for free third level education to anyone who successfully applied for a place back in the mid 90s. With all the fuss and bother recently about student tuition fees in England (in scotland, third level education is also free) a figure was mentioned saying that in the 10 years or so since 2000, the student population has quadrupled.  How big it is as a ratio I cannot tell you off the top of my head, nor have I looked up figures that can compare it to elsewhere. 
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, it was a significant increase, and I suspect was matched to some degree in the Republic as well (not least, because times were grim in the 70s and early 80s, so irish people were having tons of babies.  You know how it is). 
<br />
<br />I don't believe that college is a good fit for every kind of role in life, but in the UK, it has become the principle provider of third level education.  So my proposition is this - are the figures quoted by vox skewed heavily in favour of college graduates because that's the only game in town? or is the mix of college education to other vocational training such in the US that I'm way off base?  because if I saw those figures over here (and I'm sure I would), I'd say that if you have shit loads of college graduates, then suddenly a graduate degree is the first and easiest way of sorting the wheat from the chaff. 
<br />
<br />Total off the top of my head bollix.  like I said, there are no real numbers behind it, nor any evidence that employers would like it otherwise.</div>

<br />Ah rite, that's just me being a sanctimonious cunt, so.

<br />I do get the impression that that stuff isn't hard to fuck up though.  I know of someone who nearly shat themselves on a tube after the second round of tube bombings (which weren't very effective), because they were next to a guy with a rucksack bomb which didn't go off.  apparently he just calmly started doing chin ups and waited for the police.</div>

But we're so wired to blame p/a welfare cheats while actually lionizing bailed-out bastards that I can't really blame anyone for following along. <br /><br />It's the same illogic that puts the onus of debt reduction not on the super-rich, who are paying less in taxes now than at any time in at least sixty years, but <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/matt-taibbi/blogs/TaibbiData_May2010/239443/83512" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Social Security recipients</a>: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Social Security was never the cause of the nation's debt problems. This issue dates all the way back to the Eighties, when Ronald Reagan hired Alan Greenspan to chair the National Commission on Social Security Reform, ostensibly to deal with a looming shortfall in the fund. Greenspan's solution was to hike Social Security tax rates (they went from 9.35% in 1981 to 15.3% in 1990) and build up a &quot;surplus&quot; that could be used to pay Baby Boomers their social security checks 30 years down the road.<br /> <br />They raised the SS taxes all right, but they didn't save the money for any old Baby Boomers in the 2000s. Instead, Reagan blew that money paying for eight years of deficit spending and tax cuts. Three presidents after him used the same trick. They used about $1.69 trillion in extra Social Security revenue (from the Greenspan hikes) to pay for current-day goodies, with the still-being-debated Bush tax cuts being a great example. This led to the infamous moment during Bush's presidency when Paul O'Neill announced that the Social Security Trust Fund had no assets.<br /> <br />Well, duh! That is what happens to a fund, when you spend 30 years robbing it to pay for tax cuts for Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein. It will tend to get empty. But of course this wasn't presented to the public as being the consequence of too many handouts to wealthy campaign contributors: this was presented as a problem of those needy goddamned old people wanting to retire too early and being just far too greedy when it came to actually wanting their Social Security benefits paid out.<br />...<br />Social Security taxes are capped, which means that above a certain level (I believe it's $106,000 this year) there are no additional taxes. Which means that Jamie Dimon pays a disproportionately small amount of Social Security tax -- an arrangement that makes sense, if that money is only going to one place, i.e. back, later on, to the person who paid the taxes, in the form of Social Security benefits. <br /> <br />But if all that money is just going into a big pile to be stolen by a long line of presidents who are using it to pay for things like pointless wars and income tax cuts for their rich buddies, the Social Security cap means that this stealth government revenue source disproportionately comes from middle class taxpayers. Add in the fact that the proposed solution to the budget problem now is cutting Social Security benefits, and what you get is a double-screwing of middle-class taxpayers: first they see their Social Security taxes used to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, and then they see cuts to their benefits to pay for the fallout from that robbery.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Yeah, I know: Social Security reforms wouldn't hit current recipients. Larger point still stands.</div>
