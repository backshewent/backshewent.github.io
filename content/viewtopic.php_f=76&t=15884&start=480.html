This vote losing is no real reason another vote shouldn't happen.<br /><br />I thought I was one that complained about beating votes into the ground?</div>

			<div class="content">The thing is, the Scots very well may have gotten exactly what they wanted--further devolution that will stop short of full independence. If I'm not mistaken, the Scots themselves proposed that as an option on the ballot, and Cameron refused, believing the conventional wisdom that such an option would be the most likely winner. Cameron insisted on a simple yes/no vote. The Scots called his bluff. In the closing weeks of the election, when Yes seemed poised to to win a surprising victory, Cameron essentially caved with &quot;The Vow&quot;. Many people have suggested that uncertainty about the currency and other issues drove people into the no camp at the very end, but I suspect The Vow had a lot to do with how things worked out. <br /><br />And here's the thing--if the Vow does in fact unravel or disappoint, and the SNP types figure out the currency issues and perhaps even work out some details regarding a Scottish constitution, and if Tories continue to hold Parliament, it's not too tough to see an independence vote going the other way.</div>
