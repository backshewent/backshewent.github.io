<br />Yeah, so many of the activists on both sides are driven by what the issues groups put out.  The issues groups despise compromise and support themselves and staffs by raising money stoking outrage or fear of the slippery slope on their issue.  Things may be going 95% their way, but they'll focus on that other 5% and make it seem like the end of life as we know it.
<br />
<br />Worse than those who are naive, benighted, or uncompromisingly harsh enough to expect each campaign pledge to be fulfilled precisely as stated, are those who expect all of this to happen immediately.  Things like changed circumstances and new facts, the candidates better understanding of prior facts, the need to compromise to get things through Congress or past the executive, or just the need for some other issues to come ahead of theirs.</div>

<br />
<br />Normally I'd agree, but in this case he doesn't *have* to acquiesce, add to that the disparity between what he promised (I don't know if I like using that word here, how about planned) and what we're going to get and I think there's a legitimate complaint to be had if he doesn't make some noise. The savior promised real change, now let's see if he's willing to live up to what he promised.</div>

<br />
<br />Sure. Except that we didn't give Obama dictatorial power, and there are many considerations other than &quot;if he's willing to live up to what he promised.&quot; As Mankiew, who's worked in administrations (and, though I like him and think he's very smart, has a definite partisan interest here and generally) well knows. 
<br />
<br />For one thing, Obama's campaign promise doesn't bind the Democrats in Congress, many of whom have home-state or district interests that push them to oppose any measures like these. And Obama (or any president) has to make tough calls about where to pick his fight/s--warming, health care, NCLB reauthorization, defense spending. 
<br />
<br />Even the sequencing matters: do the wrong thing first, as Clinton did by trying to go NAFTA/health care/welfare reform, and you probably won't get more than the first one. And he didn't have the recession or two wars to deal with. 
<br />
<br />I don't mean to let Obama off the hook, and I haven't followed the cap-and-trade issue closely enough to have a good sense of whether this is the best bill they could get, or even if it's better than nothing. But this is very difficult stuff, and if he doesn't get everything one would want on a given issue, there are probably other reasons for it than poor character.</div>

<br />This is not Obama backing off on cap and trade, this is as much as Congress is willing to do.  It is this or nothing.  Still, it might make sense to take the door labeled nothing and reboot.  Perhaps just a simple carbon tax.  On the other hand, he may have gotten as much as he reasonably can at this point, with the stimulus spending for renewables and the increase in gas mileage standards.  Not a lot of point in getting too far out ahead of rest of world in current actions before the next round of climate change negotiations begin in earnest.  Without some commitments (enforceable) from China and India, anything we do is pretty much negated from a climate standpoint.  What the administration has done thus far is still helpful, and especially so from the standpoint of reducing future demand for oil imports.</div>

<br />
<br />This article from the Telegraph reinforces my post from Saturday.
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The speech gave a crystal-clear view of Mr Obama's approach to politics, but was also a token of how increasingly difficult he will find it to govern so long as he persists in thinking he is still on the campaign trail, rather than in the White House and actually running the country. Despite having won his election nearly seven months ago, and perhaps because of grumblings from critics that he could emulate Jimmy Carter and be a one-term Democrat president, Mr Obama cannot help but try to court popularity. He often does this, as in the abortion speech, by seeking to create an idea that he is somehow above differences within the American nation, and that he can represent neither camp or both camps on any question, however tendentious. It won't work. <br /><br />....<br /><br />In the legislature, the delivery of campaign promises is proving difficult despite the President's party having clear majorities in both the House and the Senate. His attempts to demonstrate a commitment to countering global warming have been impeded by Democrats from mining states worried about jobs in their districts. Those representing farming areas have hindered reform of agricultural subsidies; and the President's progress towards health care reform is sniped at as much by some of his own side, who worry about a potential $1 trillion cost and its effects on the deficit, as by his opponents. Some of the President's supporters warn him against avoiding confrontations with Congress, arguing that George W Bush's reluctance to take on the then Republican-controlled legislature exacerbated America's present economic mess, by allowing incontinent spending and the running up of enormous debt. And, of course, the economy remains the President's overriding problem. <br /><br />.....<br /><br />The disarray of the Republican party here – it remains shattered after last year's defeat, inadequately led and effective only at sniping – means Mr Obama is under little pressure for the moment to confront the really big issues, to take sides and make the really hard choices. But he can't keep fudging it, as he did at Notre Dame, for much longer. </div></blockquote></div>

<br />It's tough enough, as everyone knows, when you disagree with the party in power.  But when they renege on the few campaign policy proposals that you actually support (acting humanely to detainees by ending torture and trying terrorists with crimes, ending federal prosecutions of marijuana in states where it's legal, passing environmental reform that doesn't favor entrenched interests, etc), it's doubly depressing.  Add to that the unexpected policies (the handling of the Chrysler bailout, whereby the Obama administration seeks to overturn bankruptcy law), and &quot;I told you so&quot; is a small consolation.  Even if you didn't support the politician in the election, you can still hope he passes laws that you like.  
<br />
<br />I must admit, I enjoy pointing out that Obama isn't nearly as anti-war as some of his supporters thought he was.  His actions over the next few years in Afghanistan and Pakistan will likely surprise some people.</div>

			<div class="content">I keep thinking about that &quot;Why Democrats can't govern&quot; piece Paul pointed out a couple months back. Obama really has more trouble with his former Senate colleagues than any other group. Part of that is probably Reid's weakness as a leader, part of it must be the problems endemic in trying to hold a large and diverse coalition together, and part of it I guess would be the lingering lameness of the Democrats--their reluctance both to stand on principle and to use the full range of institutional and political tools to wage and win high-stakes fights.
<br />
<br />OTOH, it's not supposed to be easy to get legislation through the Senate. So it could be argued that the system is working as it should, and that we all collectively have become so impatient, so fixated on a news cycle or quarter or campain cycle, that we've lost sight of this truth.

<br />
<br />This is why I wouldn't say I'm outraged, as some others seem to be doing. My complaint is that he doesn't come across as willing to turn the screws available to him. I'm kind of caught between personal views here because like Atown said above regarding the cap and trade issue, maybe this is all they can get and maybe a veto threat would be just posturing, but I think he's got to exert some pressure. In a pragmatic sense, a veto is probably a waste of time, but then, I'm of the belief that posturing isn't an idle task but a worthwhile move that could pay short and long term dividends, if not necessarily with this specific piece of legislation.</div>

Of course, this is probably why he seemed fresher on the trail than all the DC-lifer types he ran against. <br /><br />I guess my issue is that for the most part, the grounds for opposition on the really big stuff like health care and (to a slightly lesser extent, owing to the objection over what China will or won't do) warming don't seem anything but interest group-driven. I can respect a guy like Gregg or Coburn opposing Obama on this or that issue because it seems likely he just really, really doesn't want to spend any money. (I wish they'd been as loud and proud on budget-hawk concerns during the last administration, but that doesn't matter now.) Someone like Lincoln or Bayh, though, just comes across to me as inane and/or hypocritical in their objections. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>kruker wrote:</cite>This is why I wouldn't say I'm outraged, as some others seem to be doing. My complaint is that he doesn't come across as willing to turn the screws available to him. I'm kind of caught between personal views here because like Atown said above regarding the cap and trade issue, maybe this is all they can get and maybe a veto threat would be just posturing, but I think he's got to exert some pressure. In a pragmatic sense, a veto is probably a waste of time, but then, I'm of the belief that posturing isn't an idle task but a worthwhile move that could pay short and long term dividends, if not necessarily with this specific piece of legislation.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I hear you. Stepping back from it, this made me think about why baseball and politics seem to be the only things that keep my interest, year after year, even as the players change: among other things (irrational love for the Phillies, hopefully somewhat more rational preference for a worldview/set of policies) the second-guessing is addictive. 
<br />
<br />Right now, I'm generally inclined to give Charlie Manuel and Obama both the benefit of most doubts. Certainly during the campaign, it invariably turned out that Obama and his team had a better idea of what they was doing than anyone else. Whether or not that skill set translates into governing strategy and tactics, I guess we'll see.</div>

<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If Obama becomes president, his first nominee to the Supreme Court will likely be Sonia Sotomayor. As a Hispanic woman with 16 years of court experience, Sotomayor would slay two of the court's lack-of-diversity birds with one swift stone. &quot;These are criteria that matter these days. Even Laura Bush was disappointed that her husband didn't name a woman to replace Sandra Day O'Connor,&quot; says Mark Tushnet, the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law at Harvard. And because Sotomayor has a reputation for staying behind the scenes and sits on a federal bench known for its centrism, it's likely that she would be able to garner a two-thirds majority in the Senate, even if the Democrats only control an estimated 55 or so seats. Plus there's an insurance measure if the nomination gets too politicized publicly: Sotomayor was appointed to the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush. Says Tushnet, &quot;If you're a Democratic strategist, you can gin up ads that say, 'She was good enough for George H. W. Bush. Why isn't she good enough for Mitch McConnell?' &quot;<br /><br />In her rulings, Sotomayor has often shown suspicion of bloated government and corporate power. She's offered a reinterpretation of copyright law, ruled in favor of public access to private information, and in her most famous decision, sided with labor in the Major League Baseball strike of 1995. More than anything else, she is seen as a realist. With a likely 20 years ahead on the bench, she'll have plenty of time to impart her realist philosophy. </div></blockquote></div>
