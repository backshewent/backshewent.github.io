			<div class="content">So the Donald vs. Fox thing flared up again, with the classy presidential candidate tweeting that network was better while she was on vacation then retweeting someone calling her a bimbo last night, Ailes firing back this AM demanding an apology, and Trump quadrupling down on attacking Kelly as a shitty journalist and whatnot. <br /><br />Some of the hosts at the network who have been anti-Trump went after him on air and on Twitter, while some of the pro-Trump folks, like  <a href="https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/636224029486116864" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Hannity</a>, went with mild chastisement. Greta, who has been the worst, retweeted Ailes' statement but didn't say anything herself about it. <br /><br />It's an interesting one because FNC has created the monster to some extent, lending him conservative bonafides with some of their hosts providing fawning coverage and glossing over his past apostasies and current incoherence in a way they never would for Jeb or Christie or Kasich or any other perceived squish. Talk radio has been worse, but Ailes and Fox deserve some of the blame for where we are. At the same time, Trump delivers ratings, and if he gives most of his interviews to CNN, will Zucker finally get one over on Ailes? Trump explicitly mentions that CNN will be covering his speech in Iowa tonight. Weird tightrope for Ailes to walk, but maybe even weirder for Trump to restart the feud in the first place. I know, Trump not being able to let go of a slight isn't weird, but Megyn Kelly is very well respected by GOP voters, is actually a pretty decent journalist by cable news standards anyway, and the controversy seemed to have went away. I don't know what political upside there is for him firing it up again. Trump got an extended interview on Hannity out of the peace accord, at some point you have to figure Ailes will have to more forcefully side with the biggest star at his network and get most of the rest on board as well. But maybe not.<br /><br />The third side of this is CNN, who have given Trump a shitload of airtime, and look like they're OK being used as Trump's bargaining chip with FNC. I guess the network has demonstrated it has little standards for news in the pursuit of ratings with their goofy plane stuff, but that's not tied up with partisan leanings, which CNN has always tried to avoid. If there is a real FNC-Trump rift I wonder if CNN will go full out whoring themselves having him on the primetime shows close to nightly, and what the downstream consequences of that will be for cable news.</div>

Frank Luntz ain't the only publicity whoar</div></blockquote><br />I dunno. Fox asked Trump hard questions at the debate (as they did with everyone), and this seems to have stuck in Trump's craw. For all of his bombast and strongman image, he's remarkably thin skinned and holds grudges. A lot of people on the network trash him regularly, but in primetime, Kelly is the only one who hasn't been at least neutral (O'Reilly) to pro (Greta and Hannity). He has taken to calling other Fox people who dislike him names - Krauthammer, George Will, Jonah Goldberg, etc. I don't think it's fake...just how he deals with criticism. <br /><br />I guess I'll probably end up watching Fox tonight from 5-7 as a result of this to see what they say, as that's been the most reliably anti-Trump portion of Mr. Ailes' network, and maybe stick around for Greta's first segment to see if she says anything. So maybe Fox benefits from the ongoing feud to some extent, though if he gives more interviews to other networks that will be short lived. And I'm not sure what Trump gets out of it. I guess headlines, but he's getting them anyway. I think it's more likely that one stubborn powerful guy thought he could patch things up with another stubborn powerful guy by emphasizing peace between the mutually benefiting entities, but the second stubborn powerful guy is too much of a pathetic whiner to stop crying in spite of the potential problems that will cause himself.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TomatoPie wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>So the Donald vs. Fox thing flared up again, with the classy presidential candidate tweeting that network was better while she was on vacation then retweeting someone calling her a bimbo last night, Ailes firing back this AM demanding an apology, and Trump quadrupling down on attacking Kelly as a #$!&@ journalist and whatnot. <br /><br />Some of the hosts at the network who have been anti-Trump went after him on air and on Twitter, while some of the pro-Trump folks, like  <a href="https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/636224029486116864" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Hannity</a>, went with mild chastisement. Greta, who has been the worst, retweeted Ailes' statement but didn't say anything herself about it. <br /><br />It's an interesting one because FNC has created the monster to some extent, lending him conservative bonafides with some of their hosts providing fawning coverage and glossing over his past apostasies and current incoherence in a way they never would for Jeb or Christie or Kasich or any other perceived squish. Talk radio has been worse, but Ailes and Fox deserve some of the blame for where we are. At the same time, Trump delivers ratings, and if he gives most of his interviews to CNN, will Zucker finally get one over on Ailes? Trump explicitly mentions that CNN will be covering his speech in Iowa tonight. Weird tightrope for Ailes to walk, but maybe even weirder for Trump to restart the feud in the first place. I know, Trump not being able to let go of a slight isn't weird, but Megyn Kelly is very well respected by GOP voters, is actually a pretty decent journalist by cable news standards anyway, and the controversy seemed to have went away. I don't know what political upside there is for him firing it up again. Trump got an extended interview on Hannity out of the peace accord, at some point you have to figure Ailes will have to more forcefully side with the biggest star at his network and get most of the rest on board as well. But maybe not.<br /><br />The third side of this is CNN, who have given Trump a #$!&@ of airtime, and look like they're OK being used as Trump's bargaining chip with FNC. I guess the network has demonstrated it has little standards for news in the pursuit of ratings with their goofy plane stuff, but that's not tied up with partisan leanings, which CNN has always tried to avoid. If there is a real FNC-Trump rift I wonder if CNN will go full out whoring themselves having him on the primetime shows close to nightly, and what the downstream consequences of that will be for cable news.</div></blockquote><br /><br />makes me think the Trump-Fox &quot;feud&quot; is as genuine as Missanelli/Innes.  Frank Luntz ain't the only publicity whoar</div></blockquote><br />I dunno. Fox asked Trump hard questions at the debate (as they did with everyone), and this seems to have stuck in Trump's craw. For all of his bombast and strongman image, he's remarkably thin skinned and holds grudges. A lot of people on the network trash him regularly, but in primetime, Kelly is the only one who hasn't been at least neutral (O'Reilly) to pro (Greta and Hannity). He has taken to calling other Fox people who dislike him names - Krauthammer, George Will, Jonah Goldberg, etc. I don't think it's fake...just how he deals with criticism. <br /><br />I guess I'll probably end up watching Fox tonight from 5-7 as a result of this to see what they say, as that's been the most reliably anti-Trump portion of Mr. Ailes' network, and maybe stick around for Greta's first segment to see if she says anything. So maybe Fox benefits from the ongoing feud to some extent, though if he gives more interviews to other networks that will be short lived. And I'm not sure what Trump gets out of it. I guess headlines, but he's getting them anyway. I think it's more likely that one stubborn powerful guy thought he could patch things up with another stubborn powerful guy by emphasizing peace between the mutually benefiting entities, but the second stubborn powerful guy is too much of a pathetic whiner to stop crying in spite of the potential problems that will cause himself.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Strongman?  He's more like a draft dodging wuss.  He tries to be a bully boy.  But like a typical bully boy,  he'll melt when he's under fire.  His foot will start to hurt and he'll have to quit.<br /><br />There is some good information regarding him on the web but our gutless journalists won't follow up on any of it.  He's good for ratings so he'll around awhile.   <br /><br />I do remember when he he got involved in the USFL and pretty much single-handedly wrecked it.  He was interviewed regarding it and of course unhooked his mike and ran away like a draft dodging wuss whose foot hurt.<br /><br />And his plan to throw all the Mexicans out of the country and build a giant wall that no one can get past would cost billions.  Good plan.  We don't need money.  Just cut the Military to the bone to pay for it.  We have guys who get captured and stuff.  We don't need that kind of thing.</div>
