Here's <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2009/02/03/quote_of_the_day.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">former Speaker Dennis Hastert</a>: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>&quot;When you really analyze it, if you want to stimulate economic growth, you have to have people investing, creating capital and creating jobs. Basically, a big part of that (stimulus package) went for extending unemployment. It's a nice thing to do, but when you extend unemployment, you take the incentive away from people to go out and get a job. So it almost has a counter negative effect.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />Maybe having Tom DeLay's hand up his ass all those years caused brain damage.</div></blockquote><br />What is economically illiterate?  He's talking in absolutes (take away incentives instead of reduce) when he shouldn't, but directionally, I don't see how he's brain damaged.  Also, so you don't thing I'm being disagreeable, the unemployment extension was a very small portion of the funds, and it is the right to do morally IMO.<br /><br />Edit: Extending unemployment benefits makes it less likely for an unemployed person to &quot;settle&quot; for a temporary low-paying position, hurting the employment numbers.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The incorrect characterization of UI as a huge portion of the measure was simple ignorance. The misunderstanding of how government spending works--basic Keynesian theory--to &quot;creat[e] jobs&quot; and get money circulating in distressed communities, thus stimulating demand, is advanced, perhaps ideologically determined ignorance.</div>

I'm not defending this--I think Daschle should have withdrawn, and/or that the administration should have pulled his nomination, and if Geithner had bowed out I would have been fine with that as well. <br /><br />But I suspect it would be almost impossible to staff an entire federal administration with people who aren't at least in an ethical gray area on some question or another. At best, what you're doing now is setting a tone such that this bunch is less compromised than previous administrations, and maybe the next Democratic president is close to what people like Sloan and Wertheimer would consider legitimately &quot;clean.&quot; <br /><br />At best.

Here's <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2009/02/03/quote_of_the_day.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">former Speaker Dennis Hastert</a>: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>&quot;When you really analyze it, if you want to stimulate economic growth, you have to have people investing, creating capital and creating jobs. Basically, a big part of that (stimulus package) went for extending unemployment. It's a nice thing to do, but when you extend unemployment, you take the incentive away from people to go out and get a job. So it almost has a counter negative effect.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />Maybe having Tom DeLay's hand up his ass all those years caused brain damage.</div></blockquote><br />What is economically illiterate?  He's talking in absolutes (take away incentives instead of reduce) when he shouldn't, but directionally, I don't see how he's brain damaged.  Also, so you don't thing I'm being disagreeable, the unemployment extension was a very small portion of the funds, and it is the right to do morally IMO.<br /><br />Edit: Extending unemployment benefits makes it less likely for an unemployed person to &quot;settle&quot; for a temporary low-paying position, hurting the employment numbers.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The incorrect characterization of UI as a huge portion of the measure was simple ignorance. The misunderstanding of how government spending works--basic Keynesian theory--to &quot;creat[e] jobs&quot; and get money circulating in distressed communities, thus stimulating demand, is advanced, perhaps ideologically determined ignorance.</div></blockquote>
<br />Yes, it is economic illiteracy or rather the enforced orthodoxy of Republican dogma that says Keynsian theory is wrong in deep recessions/depressions and supply-side theory explains all.  Here's a hint: Detroit did not shutter its production facilities because its tax rates were too high.  They did it because demand for cars has crashed, because people aren't spending.  Business inventories went up significantly in the past quarter.  Regardless of incentive tax rates given to them, businesses are not going to hire workers or increase production, let alone invest in new equipment, until the demand for their product rises.  There is too much fear and actual job loss for people to increase spending.  We can give personal tax cuts, but except for those so strapped financially that they must spend every cent they take in, a big chunk of tax cuts will be saved.  That is why the government must step in and spend borrowed money.  There is no other entity that will sustain demand.  Giving unemployment benefits to layed off workers is not just humane, it cushions the damage to the economy from their lost demand.  These folks are not spurning part-time jobs because they have these great benefits.  People are scared shitless and willing to take jobs they wouldn't have looked at a year ago.</div>

<br />You don't have to be a supply-sider to think that Keynesian stimulus packages are misguided.  It's not an either/or choice.  You can be a monetarist, and favor regulation of the money supply.  You can be an Austrian, and favor that the government not even attempt to manage the economy.  Most people take a bit from each of the disciplines.
<br />
<br />What was the government's response to the depressions of 1907 to 1920?  Were they ineffective?  Answer: The government didn't really do anything, and you've probably never heard of these recessions.
<br />
<br />It was starting in the 1920s when the fed started to get involved with regulating the money supply in attempts to bring steady economic growth.  What happened?  The 10% annual growth in the money supply  in this decade spurred overexpansion in housing (sound familiar), a run-up in asset prices due to easy credit (eerie), all caused by the artificially low interest rates pushed by the fed.  Then with the onset of the Depression, the Keynesian stimulus packages were the tools of the day, extending the Depression off and on through 1945.  I don't mean to say that what is now known as Keynesian stimulus prolonged the depression.  A lot of the failed New Deal programs (and pre-New Deal, like Smoot-Hawley) are not &quot;Keynesian&quot; in the modern usage of the word, even though they were supported by the same people at the time.  For example, price fixing has yet to be attempted, as far as I know.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that no one has learned any lessons from this.  We're in danger of repeating <span style="text-decoration: underline">everything</span>.  We enjoyed low interest rates for a prosperous decade.  We overbuilt housing.  We have other housing incentives in the tax code.  We had a huge drop in stock prices.  And the answers from the left that I've been hearing are similar to the 1930s answers... Protectionism... we must protect our local workers.  Spending... we need to have the gov't employ workers when the private industry won't.  Unemployment Insurance... we need to extend it.  Tax the wealthy... they're hoarding the money, and inequality is tearing us apart.  Mal-investment... let's build dams no ones needs, build cars no one wants to buy, build weapons for occupying Iraq, and give out money to whatever company is failing.  I'm just waiting for a bill like the Federal Farm bill to be proposed to prevent prices from dropping in some favored sectors.
<br />
<br />It is commonly held that WWII ended the Depression.  I happen to agree with some of this view, but find it unsatisfying due to the unsaid assumptions.  I don't consider a command economy, deterioration in purchasing power, and the killing of segments of our labor force a repeatable solution for ending a Depression.  It's a replication of the Broken Window fallacy combined with the killing off of part of the labor force in war.  Making a bunch of weapons, and flying your young men over to blow stuff up, should not be applauded as GDP growth.  
<br />
<br />When people say that WWII ended the Depression, I like to rephrase and say that the Depression ended any feelings of depression.  US citizens weren't worried about jobs as much, they united in the face of a common enemy, and they felt like a people who were fighting for a cause.  When the war was over, we won.

<br />You can extend the argument to monetarism or Austrian economic theory, but none of these has an effective answer to Keynsians argument that pushing on a string doesn't work.  It is all well and good to debate what economic theories work best in good times, and much of Keysian economics isn't really crafted to model good times, but these other theories really offer us nothing for the present.  Monetarism?  The floodgates are open, that should be vastly expansionary and inflationary, but it isn't happening.  Do nothing?  I think we know what happens.
<br />
<br />Protectionism is not the answer, but Republicans have taken the free trade cant to extremes.  For instance, we don't have anything approaching free trade with China.  It is a mercantilist dictatorship, complete with slave labor and military owned factories.  It absolutely does manipulate its currency and the truly massive trade deficits we run with them year in and year out make no sense at all.  Insisting on total 'free trade' with China is basically unilateral disarmament industrially.  A lot of our other Asian trading partners also cannot be said with a straight face to practice free trade.</div>

<br />It's not as big of a story here, but the Buy American clauses in the stimulus bill have been big stories abroad.  They aren't big throated cries for protectionism, they are cries to &quot;protect and create American jobs here at home.&quot;  Certainly that rhetoric sounds more familiar.

<br />Unilateral decisions to not charge tariffs helps our consumers, which is all of us.  While I think it would be better in the long-run for each country to allow free trade, it's pretty silly to complain about other countries when we have silly restrictions and WTO disputes of our own making (steel, corn, and sugar come to mind).  The Chinese have been subsidizing our consumption for years, and I see no reason to stop now.</div>
