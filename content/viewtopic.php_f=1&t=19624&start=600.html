There was a regular on the roster who proved he can handle the lead-off spot. Cesar struggled after the broken foot last year but there's every reason to expect an OBP similar to what Cutch provided.<br /><br />My impression is this staff uses sample sizes that are too small in their decision making.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Cesar has been disappointing too (on top of Herreraâ€™s stuff and Franco being bad) but Cutch getting hurt sort of opened the flood gates in terms of guys that donâ€™t belong in the majors like Williams and Quinn getting regular starts. Especially when guys like Bruce and Haseley got hurt themselves.<br /><br />I guess itâ€™s sort of a combination of everything though. If any of Cesar/Odubel/Franco have a career year or even just their best past season Cutch isnâ€™t as big of a loss.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'll disagree with you on Quinn. He's absolutely a regular for someone IF he can stay healthy.<br /><br />Most of it comes down to handling for me. There's a quick hook for some and undue patience with others. <br /><br />Going back to last year Franco gets benched quickly when he slumps. Over multiple seasons Cesar posted a .370+ OBP from the lead-off spot yet received limited chances this year. With all the development time he's lost, sporadic starts are probably the worst thing for Quinn. These 3 (and others) were not provided enough patience. I can't help but think some of it is because they're not created in Gabe's image.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Wait.<br />Not enough patience on Maik? He's had enough MLB at bats that you know what he has at this point sans any Bautista breakout or Brady Anderson diet. That was true enough last year as well. Cesar, I won't disagree, have been a bit surprised to not see him up higher in the lineup. Although to be fair, his baserunning gaffes might make a manager hesitant to put him higher. Quinn, you can argue he's sitting BECAUSE he's constantly been injured. I don't think any of it has to do with whether they're in Gabe's &quot;image&quot; or not.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, Maik's had a lot of ABs but that's not what I mean. <br /><br />I guess first you'd have to believe, like I do, that these guys need consistent playing time to be their best. You have to face live pitching to <br />hit live pitching.<br /><br />When Maik starts to slump, like all players do, he seems to lose starts much sooner than others. (I had some numbers on it last year but I'm not going thru game logs again.) I think it was a misstep to keep him mostly buried in the 8 hole this year when he was tearing the cover off the ball. There's no way opponents were going to let the 8 hitter keep beating them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I just find it hard to get up in arms about a guy with a career 2-4 WAR who has gotten about 500 PAs a year not playing consistently enough. If he has a short leash, I think it's on him at this point. I think he is what he is. And if he's losing ABs sooner than others it might have to do with things other than his not being in &quot;Gabe's image,&quot; namely that they had someone in Kingery the last two years who hadn't had the same amount of playing time yet who they thought could play the position and they wanted to see what he had.</div>

These aren't work-a-day jobs where you keep your position unless you do something wrong.<br /><br />What aspect of the team has improved over the last 2 years (or since 2015 in Klentak's case)?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Couldn't agree more, this is what I've said about this dynamic almost verbatim since last season. But it's much more significant now.<br /><br />The argument people always use to keep Kapler and/or Klentak is &quot;it's not his fault, they aren't the ones out there not hitting, it's on the players.&quot;<br /><br />And that's just the entire wrong way of looking at it. If that's the case, no manager or GM would ever be at fault for how their team plays ever. But there's something inherently or systemically wrong with this organization and you need to change something. You can't keep all the variables the same and expect the guys underperforming to magically not underperform next season.<br /><br />And with most of this lineup under contract, almost this entire lineup will be the same next year. Sans Bohm if he comes up. So it's not like they have the flexibility to change the entire lineup all over again, these are the guys you're stuck with. They need to figure out how to get the guys currently on the roster to start hitting and they've shown they clearly don't know how to make that happen collectively as an organization.<br /><br />So it's time to look for someone who can. Because even if you upgrade the pitching, that still won't solve the problem that these guys aren't hitting close to the level they're capable of(especially in this new juiced ball era).<br /><br />2nd year in a row they've spent the most money in baseball. 2nd year in a row they've headed toward a major collapse.</div>

			<div class="content">Btw, when Milty said &quot;These aren't work-a-day jobs where you keep your position unless you do something wrong.&quot;<br /><br />It's something I hear Joe Giglio say a lot on WIP's Phils post game show when fans call up angry after an embarrassing loss. &quot;What do you want him to do? It's not his fault.&quot; And it isn't just him, a lot of the Kapler supporters say that. And technically, he's not wrong in a traditional sense. It's not his fault directly that guys are screwing up and not hitting. But there's a lot of nuance in sports. It's not exactly cut and dry cause and effect. Sometimes certain guys don't respond to certain coaches and managers. It happens all the time. For reasons people like us can't explain, maybe only someone in the clubhouse could and even then maybe they can't either. Maybe it's a philosophical thing they've instilled. Who knows.<br /><br />But the bottom line is whatever the reason, fault or not, something isn't working, and thus, something needs to change. Frankly, I'm sick of the blame game, pointing fingers. I just want to fix what is broken, too much time is wasted going &quot;It's ____'s fault!&quot; &quot;No it's not, it's _____'s fault!&quot; One thing I think everyone can agree on is we just want a solution to the problem, and since not one fucking person on this planet can point to a logical reason why these guys suddenly forgot how to hit as an entire team, and you can't change the players(as I just mentioned, they're under contract) I see only one logical potential solution remaining. Only a couple things left you can change. Coaching and front office.</div>

There was a regular on the roster who proved he can handle the lead-off spot. Cesar struggled after the broken foot last year but there's every reason to expect an OBP similar to what Cutch provided.<br /><br />My impression is this staff uses sample sizes that are too small in their decision making.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Cesar has been disappointing too (on top of Herreraâ€™s stuff and Franco being bad) but Cutch getting hurt sort of opened the flood gates in terms of guys that donâ€™t belong in the majors like Williams and Quinn getting regular starts. Especially when guys like Bruce and Haseley got hurt themselves.<br /><br />I guess itâ€™s sort of a combination of everything though. If any of Cesar/Odubel/Franco have a career year or even just their best past season Cutch isnâ€™t as big of a loss.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'll disagree with you on Quinn. He's absolutely a regular for someone IF he can stay healthy.<br /><br />Most of it comes down to handling for me. There's a quick hook for some and undue patience with others. <br /><br />Going back to last year Franco gets benched quickly when he slumps. Over multiple seasons Cesar posted a .370+ OBP from the lead-off spot yet received limited chances this year. With all the development time he's lost, sporadic starts are probably the worst thing for Quinn. These 3 (and others) were not provided enough patience. I can't help but think some of it is because they're not created in Gabe's image.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Wait.<br />Not enough patience on Maik? He's had enough MLB at bats that you know what he has at this point sans any Bautista breakout or Brady Anderson diet. That was true enough last year as well. Cesar, I won't disagree, have been a bit surprised to not see him up higher in the lineup. Although to be fair, his baserunning gaffes might make a manager hesitant to put him higher. Quinn, you can argue he's sitting BECAUSE he's constantly been injured. I don't think any of it has to do with whether they're in Gabe's &quot;image&quot; or not.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, Maik's had a lot of ABs but that's not what I mean. <br /><br />I guess first you'd have to believe, like I do, that these guys need consistent playing time to be their best. You have to face live pitching to <br />hit live pitching.<br /><br />When Maik starts to slump, like all players do, he seems to lose starts much sooner than others. (I had some numbers on it last year but I'm not going thru game logs again.) I think it was a misstep to keep him mostly buried in the 8 hole this year when he was tearing the cover off the ball. There's no way opponents were going to let the 8 hitter keep beating them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Maybe that was true in the past but looking at his game log he played virtually every day for about a month and a half as his OPS dropped from 1.000 to sub .700  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/32163/maikel-franco">http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/gamelog/ ... kel-franco</a><!-- m --></div>

He stinks.  Kapler values these versatile players and I guess Hernandez needs a night off but I disagree with the Haseley move.  DFA Rodriguez, put Kingery at 3B everyday and you have Brad Miller as your utility guy.  Rodriguez doesn't add value.  At this point, Haseley will learn just as much if not more by hanging around the big club and getting MLB experience.  They are repeating last year's mistakes with veteran acquisitions mid to late season that stunt the growth of the youth and ultimately don't provide the results.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'll do one better. Release Rodriguez and bring up Alec Bohm. Make Cesar the utility guy and put Kingery at 2B. Quinn is due to get hurt and Haseley comes up. Here's your lineup:<br />CF - Adam Haseley<br />SS- Jean Segura<br />RF - Bryce Harper<br />1B - Rhys Hoskins<br />LF - Jay Bruce/Corey Dickerson<br />C - JT Realmuto <br />2B - Scott Kingery<br />3B - Alec Bohm<br /><br />At this point, there's nothing to lose.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Might as well.</div></blockquote><br /><br />So, the same lineup as now, except we're going to preemptively injure Quinn, and instead of Kingery adjusting to third base we're going to put the guy who's been learning the position at AA (making an error on one out of ten chances) and slugging at .338 clip away from Reading.<br /><br />Might as well.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well that was rather rude. Shame on you.<br /><br />At least that has guys playing in positions they've been projected for and not whatever the Wheel O'Fielding lands on that day.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Not trying to be rude, although I realize sometimes I don't have to try. My point being Kingery is almost certainly better than Bohm  at third right now, and Cesar is almost certainly better than Kingery (who has started only 7 major league games) at second. Haseley has done a creditable job in center, but he's not a real centerfielder like Quinn. So you've substantially weakened the team defensively and probably offensively as well. That's a lineup for when you don't care how many more games you win this year and you're already playing for next year. Fine if you feel that way, but I know I'm not there and I'm sure Phillies are not, nor should they be.</div>

He very clearly doesn't have the bullets he needs to succeed.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I actually subscribe more to the &quot;blow it all up&quot; philosophy than the fire Kapler idea. If you really think a change needs to be made, to me, it's an organizational shift, firing the manager who is clearly acting upon the organization's general philosophy would indicate to me that they're scrambling for answers rather than actually having solutions.<br /><br />If you're going to fire Kapler, you should fire Klentak as well and honestly probably consider Macphail as well, the organizational structure is linked together with no indication of any dissension that would require a change.<br /><br />But I would give them another offseason before I make that move. The reality is that this is the first year this team was truly built to compete for any sort of real success, and while it's been underwhelming and a bit of a slog to watch, you know a few things now that you weren't sure about coming into this season:<br /><br />1) Eflin, Pivetta, and Velasquez can't be relied upon as key major league starters.<br />2) Arrieta is more of a back of the rotation starter now than a legitimate frontline starter.<br />3) You're going to need a solution in center field at some point.<br />4) Kingery is probably a major league regular.</div>

If they came out and won 70 games each year with expectations of far better, sure. <br /><br />The difference between Kapler's record now and Charlie's record at the same point in his tenure is like six games. If you guys really want to clean house, if you're that sure about it, knock yourself out, but I swear to god if I watch Kapler go on to be Terry Francona 2.0, I'm never going to let any of you forget about it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I know, I hate when people overreact, itâ€™s getting worse than the Sixers thread on draft night</div></blockquote><br /><br />Korkmaz is basically an early 2nd round pick.</div>
