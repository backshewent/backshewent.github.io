I did not have to borrow the full amount, and likely would have chosen a different school if I had been forced to. I qualified for need-based aid in a mix of grants and loans, so my loan payments are very reasonable.</div>

We might as well formally adopt a feudal system of feudal lords and fiefdoms, with a small noble class and an enormous, uneducated peasant class.

One should probably not take out a loan for $160+k if they can help it, particularly if the prospects for lucrative employment upon graduation are dim. Many fields require advanced education beyond undergrad to get the desired job.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The basic principals of this pension reform proposal are summarized below:.<br /><br />â€¢	No changes are being proposed for current retired public school or state employees<br /><br />â€¢	No changes will occur for any current employees any earlier than January 1, 2015.  Additionally, the value of benefits accrued by employees will not be diminished.. <br /><br />â€¢	Changes to the  retirement calculation will be effective for SERS employees on Jan. 1, 2015 and for PSERS employees on July 1, 2015. Specifically, the proposal:<br />o	Reduces the multiplier in the formula used to determine future pension benefits by .5 percent for all employees that are currently locked into a multiplier above the 2 percent level, except for those who previously bought up to the higher multiplier. Current employees can still keep their higher multiplier by paying a higher contribution rate, which is yet to be determined.  <br />o	Caps pensionable income at the Social Security wage base, which is $113,700 for 2013.<br />o	Caps pensionable compensation to 110 percent of the average salary of the prior 4 years when determining an employeeâ€™s final average earnings. <br />o	Determines an employeeâ€™s final salary by averaging the employeeâ€™s last five years of compensation.<br />o	For employees who choose to withdraw their contributions, pension payments will be based on the amount remaining in their pension account.<br /></div></blockquote><br />pretty close to what i'd do, except requiring current enrollees to pay a higher percentage. it's coupled with some really weird proposals to privatize a bunch of parts of the government, though, and i'm not talking about liquor. from what i can tell, he's not going to a 401k system YET, but wants to march towards it? am i reading this wrong?</div>

At that point you've renounced your citizenship in practice if not in name, and you shouldn't be allowed to wield your citizenship as a shield as you work to harm the US. If it's good enough for bombing Yemenis in Yemen, it's good enough for bombing Americans in Yemen. I continue to struggle with the concept of people being OK with blowing up entire traveling parties but being opposed to rendition and enhanced interrogation of high value subjects. But I think we've had that argument before here, and I've been told my moral compass is askew.</div>

I did not have to borrow the full amount, and likely would have chosen a different school if I had been forced to. I qualified for need-based aid in a mix of grants and loans, so my loan payments are very reasonable.</div></blockquote><br />I have 18k per year in grants and scholarships. I'm still going to end up 100-110k in debt for my political science degree.  I could have probably ended up saving 20-30 grand going to a state school but I think I benefited educationally and socially going to a smaller university. <br /><br />I guess I take exception with the idea that I shouldn't educate myself because my parents make just enough money to not qualify for a lot of need based aid while also not having the ability to pay my tuition.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Also, Werthless's idea essentially means that anyone interested in teaching pretty much anything will have to come from substantial means.  No more teachers who come from the working classes; only those from priviliged backgrounds need apply.<br /><br />That's a great way to reduce the quality of teaching.</div></blockquote><br />There are ways to become a teacher, or an artist, or to follow any other career path that has a low expected income without going $160,000 into debt. That's my argument. If you don't think this is true, that it's not possible to go leverage some combination of [community college, state schools, merit scholarships, need based grants, etc] to prevent $160,000 in loans from accruing, then I don't want you teaching my kid anyway.</div>
