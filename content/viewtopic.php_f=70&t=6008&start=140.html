<br />
<br />Clearly, there are institutional issues. But I really don't think it can be traced to the need to get re-elected. When 90+% of incumbents are re-elected, and most represent what should be considered &quot;safe&quot; districts, to cite the need to get re-elected as a reason for the dysfunction of the legislative branch seems spurious.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I would make the opposite argument--regardless of how little they do, and how poorly  they govern, it's too easy for them to hold their seats.</div>

<br />what i hope, is for a bipartisan commission to be created by president obama with the goal, not of digging up all the dirt of the bush administration, but of investigating the way that the acts can be reversed if an idiot as dangerous as bush was ever again elected to an office as high as president.
<br />
<br />
<br />oh, and olbermann has called both hillary and obama out on multiple occasions in multiple special comments.  maybe he'll turn into an obama administration talking head once elected, but if right now you're calling him dead in the pocket of obama, you need to watch him more often.</div>

<br />If Obama is President, we'll have... well... I wouldn't use those terms, but we'll have someone who is inexperienced and naive who stubbornly refuses to admit he's wrong and ignores facts that differ from what he believes. How will it be different? There are people who believe that electing Obama will be dangerous, just as I'm sure people believe the same about John McCain. Obama supporters seem to completely ignore all critique of their candidate and dismiss those with real concerns as racists.</div>

<br />
<br />You can't be serious? You are calling Obama out on grounds of inexperience? This is a joke right? And you think he's &quot;dangerous&quot;? In what way? What could be more dangerous that proto-facist, neo-con idealogs with puppet evnagelists with former cocaine and booze habits? 
<br />
<br />You know as well as I do, that no figure that becomes President can just act on their own. There's a system and a machine and a way things work. As long as big business is thriving, things go on. As long as the facade is maintained.
<br />
<br />The &quot;real&quot; differences between these two are there, but not that great in the big scheme. And if you dislike Obama, or the DNC or the Dems or liberals -- that's fine. But don't try to act like Obama isn't qualified to play the part, or could get us in worse trouble that W who is universally hated the world over.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Philly the Kid wrote:</cite>You can't be serious? You are calling Obama out on grounds of inexperience? This is a joke right? </div></blockquote><br />What experience does Barack Obama have? George Bush spent six years as governor of Texas. That was a full time job. Obama spent eight years in the Illinois State Senate. The Senate meets for only five months. That's a part time job. In the three years he's been in the Senate he's authored two bills of any note and has spent almost as much time on the campaign trail as in office. Barack Obama's inexperience is the single biggest non-ideological complaint people have about his candidacy. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>And you think he's &quot;dangerous&quot;? In what way? What could be more dangerous that proto-facist, neo-con idealogs with puppet evnagelists with former cocaine and booze habits? </div></blockquote><br />While your rhetoric is full of hyperbole, what can be more dangerous is a man who doesn't seem to understand that if we fail in Iraq, Iran, our single biggest threat, will step into the vacuum. Iraq is at the center of numerous potentially troublesome countries that have oil, something America seems to want stable every time they fill up their cars. Obama is someone who made up his mind about Afghanistan and Iraq without going to the countries, talking to their leaders, or our commanders. After doing so, all he could say was that everything he thought before he went was right. He somehow believes that al Quaeda has bases in Afghanistan and that a country that has no strategic value and an insurgency of 19th century fighters is more important. For hundreds of years foreign countries have learned that you can't win in Afghanistan. Yet Obama wants to fight there anyway.<br /><br />What's dangerous is someone who seems to have no concept of how the American economic system works and whose positions need to be &quot;clarified&quot; every time he gives them out. His economic policies are eerily reminiscent of Jimmy Carter's, a time when inflation was double today's.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The &quot;real&quot; differences between these two are there, but not that great in the big scheme. And if you dislike Obama, or the DNC or the Dems or liberals -- that's fine. But don't try to act like Obama isn't qualified to play the part, or could get us in worse trouble that W who is universally hated the world over.</div></blockquote>
<br />There are certainly differences between Bush and Obama, but the similarities are what disturb me. I like a lot of Democrats. I've voted for them in the last four Presidential elections and in Senate and Congressional elections. I like liberals for standing up for the little guy and being idealistic. Barack Obama doesn't have the experience to be President and that's an important qualification for me. I'd have thought he'd try to have a more distinguished Senate career before running for President. He's chosen to treat it as a part time job. 
<br />
<br />I don't care if the President is hated the world over. I care that the President does the right thing. Richard Nixon wasn't liked, but he dealt from a position of strength when he went to China and the USSR. Ronald Reagan was perceived by the Europeans as a war monger. Yet he brought the Soviets down. A President needs to negotiate from strength. These countries needed to be afraid of our President to negotiate. The Europeans think Obama is going to take their advice in forming American foreign policy. That's why they love him.</div>

<br />I think it works if you don't develop a powerful counter-narrative. Certainly it did against Kerry four years ago. The Obama people claim that they've learned from the mistakes of past Democratic candidates; guess we'll see.</div>
