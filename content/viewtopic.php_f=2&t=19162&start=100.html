Current feds, including new hires, are enrolled in the &quot;new&quot; pension system called FERS. You get 1% of your &quot;high 3&quot; for every year you work, 1.1% per year if you wait until age 62 to retire. Most careerists therefore end up with a pension that replaces 30-40% of their salary. Not great, but still a nice perk. Pension + Social Security ends up replacing about 70%-80% of a Federal retiree's high 3, which is right in line with what the old school CSRS pension paid. <br /><br />Keep in mind that those under CSRS contribute 7% of their income to the pension system and do not receive Social Security benefits. Most current Federal employees are grandfathered in under a plan by which they contribute 0.8% to the FERS system and 6.2% to Social Security, so the total contribution is equal.<br /><br />On top of that, employees enrolled in FERs also get a 100% match on the first 5% of their salary that they contribute to the TSP.<br /><br />All told, an argument can certainly be made that FERS is a more generous pension system than CSRS.<br /><br />With that said, I agree with your main point, which is that the GOP has turned the public against public servants. It's despicable.</div>

			<div class="content">Speaking of messages:<br /><br />@realDonaldTrump<br />I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market, don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!<br />4:13 AM - 18 Dec 2018<br /><br />Gee, who do I trust more on economic matters, the people who study the topic for a living or the guy who bankrupted all his casinos?</div>

			<div class="content">The thing about the IRS people should keep in mind is that demonizing means it's politically easier to understaff it, which means you might not get your refund as quickly as you'd like (though I've never had a problem with that) but more importantly, when you do have a question and need to talk to someone like threecount, your hold time is likely to be longer. It becomes more inconvenient to resolve issues. I also remember reading somewhere that adequately funding the IRS would mean higher levels of compliance with tax laws, which would in fact help reduce the deficit. (And sure, that means some people would pay more taxes, but complaining about that seems like complaining about DUI checkpoints--not paying taxes is against the law, and the victims are the honest taxpayers.)<br /><br />If there's a problem, it's that the IRS seems to go after little people, because they're much less likely to be able to defend themselves rather than the Trumps of the world.</div>
