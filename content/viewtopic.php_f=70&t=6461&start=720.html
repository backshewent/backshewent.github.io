<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>McCain seemed happy to have Palin along for their first joint town hall, asking her to jump in on the conversation, notably on energy issues, which McCain's campaign has been promoting as Palin's strong suit. When asked by one voter how and where oil from offshore drilling could be secured, Palin cited her experience on energy issues in Alaska, saying she would work to make the resources that &quot;belong to the people&quot; available.<br /><br />&quot;It's a matter of Congress allowing these lands to be tapped -- the offshore drilling -- the allowance given there, also, for safe, reliable and ethical drilling of these resources,&quot; Palin said. &quot;Yes, the oil companies have the leases, the right to develop; they also have a duty to develop when it's economic, when people are hurting, they need to tap those resources and get those sources flowing. That's part of the reform that we're going to usher in to D.C., and we did that up in Alaska.&quot;<br /><br />But when asked how she would help keep any new domestic oil produced in the United States, Palin gave a less-than-well-articulated non-answer.<br /><br />&quot;Oil and coal? Of course, it's a fungible commodity and they don't flag, you know, the molecules, where it's going and where it's not. But in the sense of the Congress today, they know that there are very, very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first,&quot; Palin said. &quot;So, I believe that what Congress is going to do, also, is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it's Americans that get stuck to holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here, pumped here. It's got to flow into our domestic markets first.&quot;</div></blockquote></div>

<br />He said nothing. Barney Frank was terrific on Charlie Rose the other night. I'd really like to see what a Frank McCain discussion would yield. Let alone anyone who really knows McCain's record and who he's been bidding for and in cahoots with. Why don't they ask him why it isn't time now to reign that &quot;greed&quot; in with regulation. Who will be his economic advisors? (phill gramm? other like him?) He's all style and no substance in this.</div>

John McCain's town hall style meetings &quot;are generally open to the public where anyone may wait in line on the day of the event and come in without an advanced invitation,&quot; according to Fox News.<br /><br />However, at last night's 3,500 person townhall in Michigan -- &quot;the first time Palin is taking questions from the public -- only ticketholders are allowed in. People had to pick up their tickets at local GOP offices after RSVPing for the event.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />While openness to the public and a willingness to answer all questioners is important and admirable, it pales in significance compared to the imperative of protecting the delicate flower of Alaskan womanhood...<br /><br />Seriously, why are these guys so terrified of Palin having to face questions from journalists or voters?</div></blockquote><br />The campaign views Palin not as someone running for something, but as someone who can help McCain get elected. So they are rolling her out slowly. In all fairness, how long was Obama on the campaign trail before he even did a town hall? Do you really expect them to throw her to the wolves in her first town hall? And really, who cares if they do or don't? It's John McCain the Dems are focused on. <br /><br />I recognize ptk gets all of his hard news from the DNC, but I fail to see why people who've had their homes foreclosed and the mail doesn't forward shouldn't be stricken from the roles. You must vote in the precinct where you live. If you no longer live in a home you can't vote in that precinct. I'm pretty sure that applies to Republicans too. Perhaps get both sides of the story and then make up your mind.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I knew this would be you reaction Lax. I knew you would try to justify it. Rather than recognize how 'out of step' it is to even think this stuff up? Why are republicans making concerting efforts to find ways to disenfranchise voters. I'm not getting in to your game of nitpiking over whether those people still live there. If they show up to vote at their normal precinct, they surely haven't strayed far -- it's a maliciousness of republicans to come up with these plans. What do you say about the business of forcing 5 hour lines in African American neighborhoods/ You have an answer for everythning, I'd respect it more if you just said, republicans will do anything to win, and they scheme this stuff up to get an edge.</div>

What's the matter, are you afraid she can't handle it?  You want her to be VP, but she can't handle a few unrehearsed question and answers?  If you have such doubts, and you're a McCain supporter, imagine how the average American must feel.<br /><br />Oh, and I care.  And I'm sure many many others care.  If this woman wants to be a heartbeat away from the most powerful job on the planet and she can't handle some questions, then I care about that.  It's made especially important since McCain is looking pretty feeble, IMO, and refuses to release portions of his medical records.  Even a member of his own campaign staff said that &quot;Most doctors&quot; believe McCain will be alive at the end of his 1st term.  Most doctors?!?!  MOST?!?!  1st term!?!?  I can only fill in the logical conclusion that some doctors don't think he'll make it.  And the 2nd term is, I guess, completely up in the air.<br /><br />So her ability to handle a few questions without spending weeks preparing for them is kinda important, you know.  How can a serious candidate for any public office behave this way and expect us to take him/her seriously?<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:  Oh, and it's the Reps who have put her front and center.  If you want her front and center, following McCain around and helping him get people to his rallies, then she has to be fair game.  You can't have it both ways.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I hate getting in to this game -- because its so obvious, I don't need to stie this stuff -- BUT -- Republican noize-makers have told us she has more executive experience, she's a darn governor afterall, running a full state, she tore it up as a mayor and fought big interests... so why does she need to be 'eased' in. I think its OUTRAGEOUS that the media cut her any slack and should be demanding she give interviews to voters and media without shielding -- and if not, they should blow her to bits in the press, stop covering the 'feel good mom' nonsense and call it what it is. It's all a maneuver that inidcates she's not there for policy and qualifications for her addition to the ticket in substance, but jsut the mythology they are trying to create, perception to give people who need a reason to vote for them, a reason -- not based in anything but illusion.
<br />
<br />Let he talk! Or call her an imposter.</div>

<br />I believe you need a home address in order to vote. You're supposed to bring in the card they mail you. If you are homeless and live under a bridge, as most Democrats do, then you can register the homeless shelter as your home address.

Rather than recognize how 'out of step' it is to even think this stuff up? Why are republicans making concerting efforts to find ways to disenfranchise voters. I'm not getting in to your game of nitpiking over whether those people still live there. If they show up to vote at their normal precinct, they surely haven't strayed far -- it's a maliciousness of republicans to come up with these plans. What do you say about the business of forcing 5 hour lines in African American neighborhoods/ You have an answer for everythning, I'd respect it more if you just said, republicans will do anything to win, and they scheme this stuff up to get an edge.</div></blockquote>
<br />I'm not trying to justify anything. It's amazing how you can be completely partisan in your post and then get indignant because you think I'm partisan. It's rich that you say you'd respect me more if I just came around to your point of view.
<br />
<br />My reaction was that you were taking liberal talking points and presenting them as facts. I like to get a complete picture, especially from those doing the disenfranchising before I make up mind. Is that necessary for you? Don't you have any intellectual curiosity to actually investigate these things and find out the explanation from the horse's mouth? I'd respect you if you actually investigated things before posting about them and gave them a thorough analysis before drawing conclusions.
<br />
<br />I'm sure some Republicans have done fiendish schemes to disenfranchise poor people. You want me to blanket the entire Republican Party as dishonest without any evidence. If people here actually read my posts they'd see me admitting a lot of things about the Republican Party. Go back to the last page where I say that McCain hasn't run the respectful campaign they promised. The campaign has given repeated false and misleading statements about Obama. I write things like this. They're ignored. No Democrat, or socialist like yourself, is writing anything critical of Obama or the Democratic Party. And yet somehow I'm the partisan hack.</div>

<br />You make it sound like the Republicans control every single voting commission in the country. Some of the people doing these things are Democrats. I have no idea if poor whites are being stricken from the rolls. I don't know that poor blacks are either. You need a home address in order to vote. That's not a technicality. That's the way voter registration is done. Oh. i mentioned registration. Another plot to disenfranchise blacks I'm sure.</div>

Yes. I still would like to know that everyone that wants to vote can vote.

Some of the people doing these things are Democrats. I have no idea if poor whites are being stricken from the rolls. I don't know that poor blacks are either. You need a home address in order to vote. That's not a technicality. That's the way voter registration is done. Oh. i mentioned registration. Another plot to disenfranchise blacks I'm sure.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Just for the record, I never called you a partisan hack. I do think you have some resistance to admitting many of the aggressive unsavory tactics of republicans. I don't say that Dems don't do bad stuff too, but it's not apples to apples. It's not. ALl the funny business, all the controversies that surround these disputes and election stuff after 00 and 04 and coming now for 08, are always around rep operatives scheming up things that go after Dem districts or targets, often people of color. Of course, I investigate the efficacy of these statements. DemNOw said right up front that they invited the rep people on and they refused. But I&quot;m sure you will likely tell me, that they know the agenda of that show so why would they go on. No matter what anyone says, you have that neat lawyering game you like to play. Always find an angle to argue.
<br />
<br />I don't think you are  hack. I think you are a very genuine and thoughtful person, who tries really hard to discern things. We differ on some values and views, but I think you are a good guy that means well. I just think you are also very averse to what you see as wildly silly liberals...
<br />
<br />You have called McCain out on not running the clean campaign you had hoped. I just think that sometimes you are a bit naive as to how things work for real. That's all.
<br />
<br />It's nothing personal.</div>

<br />So are you going to play the East Fallowfield role where you find everything the Republicans ever did wrong, and put clever link titles like &quot;Makin' Progress&quot;? Cus that will get old. 
<br />
<br />You're the Google whiz, why don't you spend an hour or so determining if Allen Ariza really did play minor league baseball. That would be using your powers for good.</div>
