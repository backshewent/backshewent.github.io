			<div class="content">There is a lot of alarmingly intelligent analysis of HL in this thread.<br /><br />My problem with the decision is its privileging of the right of a fictive entity to freedom exercise of religion over the the right of individuals to live as they please, and civil libertarians everywhere ought to be equally concerned.  I think Ruth Bader-Ginsburg generally got it right: any individuals right to religious freedom ends at the end of his or her nose/fingertips; my right to religious freedom does not allow me to encroach on anyone else's right to engage in any legal activity in which s/he chooses to engage.  But corporations who employ people, owing to the particular nature of what it is to employ someone in a country where health insurance is tied to employment, do encroach on individual rights when they assert &quot;freedom of religion&quot; in refusing to pay for contraceptive care (and this by the way says nothing about whether 'contraceptives' are always taken by women for the express purpose of preventing pregnancy, which they are not; they have other palliative effects for which they might be legitimately prescribed). <br /><br />I also have a problem with the fact that, in awarding certain freedoms of consciousness to corporate entities, the court essentially drew arbitrary lines of demarcation as to where a corporation may or may not have religious beliefs.  Matters of sexual morality are apparently fair game, but the court showed &quot;consciousness of guilt,&quot; or at least an understanding of the potentially ruinous affects of its own logic, by going out of its way to cite examples where a corporation wouldn't have religious freedom, like in whether or not to cover vaccinations.   The majority attempted to defend this position by citing compelling government interest as part of the strict scrutiny test, but this whole process gives away the game: corporations may be fictive persons, but they don't really make INDIVIDUAL choices; any choice they make affects more than the corporate entity itself, and, importantly, its owners, and as such they should not be treated, with respect to religion at anyrate, as a person making personal decisions about personal morality.  <br /><br />Bottom line: you don't want to provide health insurance that includes access to birth control?  Then don't run a business.  No one is putting a gun to your head.  If you run a business, you will of necessity have contact with people who did not share your religious beliefs, and your right to yours should not and should never permit you to affect someone else's legal choices about their own lives.</div>

One of the fundamental flaws of all the writing on Harris v. Quinn and &quot;agency fee&quot; or &quot;fair share&quot; in general (and I suspect this on the part of at least some people an intentional flaw, meant to push a certain political position with respect to the idea) is that this is somehow about state laws requiring people to pay union dues.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/supreme-court-harris-v-quinn-ruling-108428.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">This article</a> on Harris v. Quinn used to have language exactly to that effect, but I tweeted them about it (and maybe others?) and they evidently changed it (the article used to refer to &quot;state laws requiring public-sector workers to pay union dues.&quot;  <br /><br />First of all, agency fee is not full union dues; it is a percentage, and the funds collected may only be used for 'normal' union functions - paying salaries of people who negotiate and enforce contracts, etc.  I work for a union, and believe me: despite what Alito writes in the majority opinion, there is very little difficulty about distinguishing between &quot;chargeable&quot; (i.e., purely contract-related) and &quot;non-chargeable&quot; (i.e., political work, etc.) expenses, because we are watched like HAWKS by the IRS.  The rules are very clear, and they are tightly followed, or else everyone goes to jail, and we all know it.<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, there is NO state law that requires non-members to pay dues.  Agency fee may only be collected in the first place if there is a state law that PERMITS it to be collectively bargained from the state.  There is a world of difference between those two concepts.  Public sector unions may only be formed in the first place by a majority vote of the affected workers, and the unions they form may only collect agency fee if the union bargains that from the state, <span style="font-style: italic">and then the contract is ratified by a majority vote of membership</span>.  <br /><br />In other words, there is no real distinction betwee &quot;the union&quot; and its members.  All unionization is done first and foremost on a local level, by a vote of the workers directly affected.  Their contracts are similarly bargained.  Members may vote down a contract if they wish.  A dissenting worker, one who voted against the union and against the contract, may be required ONLY to pay a minimum fee, and only then if a majority voted for the union AND FOR THE CONTRACT, just as a taxpayer who voted against the current government and called his legislator to block the new legislation may only be charged regular taxes and may not be compelled to donate to his legislator's next campaign.  Furthermore, any such dissenting member is free to say anything he likes at all about the union or its leadership (which, again, is democratically elected from among the local set of employees), including organizing his co-workers against a contract, or against the union itself.  It happens all the time.  I have worked in public sector settings where union members voted no on contracts that the elected leadership of the union recommended, and where members voted the union out of existence entirely.  <br /><br />The point is, there are democratic remedies, and a non-member paying agency fee in no way has any limits placed on him/her in terms of what s/he may say or do to work against the union if s/he wishes, and if a majority agree, s/he will get his/her way.  A fee payer may even join the union formally and run for office PURELY to undo the union, which I have seen happen, and work.</div>

One of the fundamental flaws of all the writing on Harris v. Quinn and &quot;agency fee&quot; or &quot;fair share&quot; in general (and I suspect this on the part of at least some people an intentional flaw, meant to push a certain political position with respect to the idea) is that this is somehow about state laws requiring people to pay union dues.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/supreme-court-harris-v-quinn-ruling-108428.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">This article</a> on Harris v. Quinn used to have language exactly to that effect, but I tweeted them about it (and maybe others?) and they evidently changed it (the article used to refer to &quot;state laws requiring public-sector workers to pay union dues.&quot;  <br /><br />First of all, agency fee is not full union dues; it is a percentage, and the funds collected may only be used for 'normal' union functions - paying salaries of people who negotiate and enforce contracts, etc.  I work for a union, and believe me: despite what Alito writes in the majority opinion, there is very little difficulty about distinguishing between &quot;chargeable&quot; (i.e., purely contract-related) and &quot;non-chargeable&quot; (i.e., political work, etc.) expenses, because we are watched like HAWKS by the IRS.  The rules are very clear, and they are tightly followed, or else everyone goes to jail, and we all know it.<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, there is NO state law that requires non-members to pay dues.  Agency fee may only be collected in the first place if there is a state law that PERMITS it to be collectively bargained from the state.  There is a world of difference between those two concepts.  Public sector unions may only be formed in the first place by a majority vote of the affected workers, and the unions they form may only collect agency fee if the union bargains that from the state, <span style="font-style: italic">and then the contract is ratified by a majority vote of membership</span>.  <br /><br />In other words, there is no real distinction betwee &quot;the union&quot; and its members.  All unionization is done first and foremost on a local level, by a vote of the workers directly affected.  Their contracts are similarly bargained.  Members may vote down a contract if they wish.  A dissenting worker, one who voted against the union and against the contract, may be required ONLY to pay a minimum fee, and only then if a majority voted for the union AND FOR THE CONTRACT, just as a taxpayer who voted against the current government and called his legislator to block the new legislation may only be charged regular taxes and may not be compelled to donate to his legislator's next campaign.  Furthermore, any such dissenting member is free to say anything he likes at all about the union or its leadership (which, again, is democratically elected from among the local set of employees), including organizing his co-workers against a contract, or against the union itself.  It happens all the time.  I have worked in public sector settings where union members voted no on contracts that the elected leadership of the union recommended, and where members voted the union out of existence entirely.  <br /><br />The point is, there are democratic remedies, and a non-member paying agency fee in no way has any limits placed on him/her in terms of what s/he may say or do to work against the union if s/he wishes, and if a majority agree, s/he will get his/her way.  A fee payer may even join the union formally and run for office PURELY to undo the union, which I have seen happen, and work.</div></blockquote><br />Money is fungible.</div>
