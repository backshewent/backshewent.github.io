This isn't offered as a defense of the contract, rather, I think it makes the comparison to Fielder's contract less favorable--the pro-Rube argument is that the Phillies are on the hook for a lot less money, because from here forward they're only on the hook for 135 million. But if we go back to when the extension was signed, that means they will end up paying Howard only 40 million less than Fielder from the time the extension was signed, not 90 million less.</div>

			<div class="content">And there was a joetable post earlier in this thread in which he said that no one would have given him this contract on the open market because of team needs in 2012.  Found it funny that he listed the Angels/Tigers as 2 of the teams that are set at 1st/have prospects ready or near ready.  Just goes to show you how strange things work out.<br /><br />The same could have been said for SS and the Marlins, but they nabbed Reyass anyway</div>

I like that he slimmed down and worked on his D. But there is reality -- and reality has shown that these kind of players can really slip and have injury issues. We don't have DH. If he ends up like Thome, productive year after year -- I'll be cool. But he has like 1-2 more good years and a steep slide -- yikes...<br /><br />I like emotionally the idea of wrapping up Ryan and Chase -- these guys have HOF potential and its nice to think that we can enjoy an extended era of Phillies Baseball with some homegrown stars... but geez that's a lot of money and a lot of committment? Will salaries keep going up during the next 5 so that it looks less bad toward the end? Payroll for the Phils keep going up?? <br /><br />If Ibanez and Moyer weren't here now sucking down over-priced contracts and I felt there was a chance Werth could stay ... JRoll? what's his future now? You know he over-values his own worth and will probably end up back on the west coast or sometihng...<br /><br />I like the spiprit of taking care of your own and building fixtures like Chase and Ryan for the kids to grow up with -- but this is a really dangerous deal for all the reasons everyone else is referencing obviously...<br /><br />I just hope he keeps banging 40hrs 120rbi seasons year after year after year... maybe get better on facing lefties and curve balls and sliders?!<br /><br />Can only hope for the best, not bemoan what might NOT go right...<br /><br />Congrats to Ryan on the pay-day dude....</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Trent Steele wrote:</cite>I'm just starting to comprehend how absolutely awful this is.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>joe table wrote:</cite>No one would have given him that contract on the open market. <br /><br />You have FAs after this season of Pena, Lee, Konerko and Dunn.

Texas, Atlanta, Mets, Toronto have solid prospects at the position that are either ready or near ready.<br /><br />Florida, Pitt, Tampa, Oakland, San Diego, Brewers (because if they can't sign Fielder, why would they Ryan?), don't have the finances to even consider signing him. DBacks and Indians are borderline, but also have 1B prospects of their own (Allen, LaPorta/Weglarz)<br /><br />That leaves: LA Dodgers, Cubs, Cardinals, Boston, White Sox, Baltimore, Washington, San Fran, Houston, Seattle needing 1B either next year or after 2011.

Boston will probably end up with Gonzalez, who is younger and a higher OBP guy, or perhaps sign Pena after 2010. Either way I can't see them being in the 2011 market to help raise these players' prices. So that's both NY and BOS out of the market! Can't see the SABR-friendly Mariners throwing that type of money around to a 32 year old Howard. <br /><br />Where is that 25mm AAV contract coming from?

He might or might not have gotten something this good on the open market after 2011; probably depends on the state of the economy at that point, honestly.

He's 30, has a bad body, is not a good defender, and has struggled to make contact to versus lefties -- he's gone backwards in that area over the past couple of years. If you were locking him up through age 31, it's not so bad. How happy are if you're Albert Pujols? If Howard is worth $25 million, Pujols is worth $50 million a year.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Trent Steele wrote:</cite>this contract makes me want to punch amaro in his vagina</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>FTN wrote:</cite>The easy initial reaction = this deal is terrible.<br /><br />But I don't think its that easy, for a number of really simple reasons.<br /><br />1. The Phillies are one of the 5 best teams in baseball, they have been over the last 4 years, and there is nothing to indicate they won't be in the next 5 years. Howard, no matter how you measure &quot;value&quot; has been an integral part of the lineup since he became a full time player. His faults are obvious, but he really only has one obvious fault, and that is his performance against LHP. Lots of big power hitters struggle against their same side platoon. Not many lefties kill LHP. But Howard is one of the 2 best hitters in baseball against RHP. And I see no real reason that skill will drop off. The other knocks on Howard are red herrings. His &quot;bad body&quot; really isn't bad. He's a big dude, but he's not fat anymore, and he runs well enough for a player his size. His defense still won't be confused with that of Keith Hernandez, but he's not a liability there, and I'm not convinced that the value of defense at 1B is as important as it is at the key up the middle positions. Howard moves well enough around the bag, he makes a fair number of running catches on popups, and he's good at digging balls out of the dirt. So the one knock against him, and its real, is his performance against lefties. The rest of the criticisms are poorly constructed at best.<br /><br />2. Building on #1, the Phillies had to have figured out something if Howard left via free agency. Option 1 was trading for Adrian Gonzalez, and then paying him $25M per year. Option 2 was signing Prince Fielder on the open market. What would the market be by then? What if the Cardinals had given Pujols a 6/210M deal? Howard would have surely gotten 5/145. Fielder, because he's younger, might have gotten 8/215. There is no discount here. Its a ton of money. But there wouldn't have been a discount on the free agent market either. Agents understand that the Phillies would have had to get a marquee name to replace Howard at 1B if they let him go. There wouldn't have likely been any bargains. Maybe you can sign a good hitter at 5/85 to play 1B, but will he have produced as much as Howard?<br /><br />3. I think its almost pointless to look at Howard's comparable hitters on BR or BP. His career arc is very unique, and while it seems the guys he is often compared to broke down and lost their physical shape as they aged, Howard is going in the opposite direction. The game of baseball is very different now than it was even 10 years ago, let alone 25 or 50 years ago. Guys take better care of themselves, they have more opportunities and possibilities as far as training and preparation goes, and the medical staffs are 100x better now than they were 50 years ago. If Howard turns into Mo Vaughn, and he might, it will be because of an injury or because he just let himself go. But he hasn't shown any indication that he's planning on letting himself go physically, and in fact, he looks better now than he did 4 years ago.<br /><br />4. Howard's salary hurts the Phillies in 3 years if payroll stays the same. Since its generally understood that teams spend 80-90% of their revenue generated, if the Phillies continue to play well, sell out games, and raise prices of services, then there is no reason payroll will be cut, and in fact, payroll should continue to increase. It was $140M this year, but it could well be $150M next year and 160M in 2012. Obviously it still reduces the margin for error, but this team is basically assembled for the next 5 years anyway. Some of the fringe parts will need to be replaced and recycled, but the core won't. There is a bunch of salary coming off the books after 2010, and the money to sign Werth will be there, as long as his demands are reasonable. He's never stated that he didn't want to play in Philly, or that he couldn't wait to test the open market. In fact, I bet the Phillies already know exactly what the number is that he'll require to sign. And I wouldn't be shocked if they sign him in the next 3 months. <br /><br />5. Make no mistake. The Phillies probably overpaid. No, they did overpay. But I don't view this as something that is going to hamstring the team down the road. If ownership suddenly tells Rube the payroll is going from $140M to $110M next year, then there will be problems. But there is no indication that the team is cutting payroll any time soon, and in fact, payroll has been steadily rising. This move doesn't hurt all that much. There won't really be any big free agent signings this winter, because there won't be many real needs. They will have $20M or so to re-sign Werth, maybe bring in a starter, and maybe bring in a reliever. <br /><br />We overpaid. And I'm not sure why we did it now. But this isn't end of days stuff. The team will be fine.</div></blockquote><br /><br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br /><br />Thats as far as I got.
