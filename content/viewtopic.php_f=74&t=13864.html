			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am the manager of a small apartment complex in the downtown area of<br />irrelevant city. I have seen a lot of messed up stuff over the last<br />three years, like one of those &quot;cat ladies&quot; you only hear about in<br />folk lore. She died and they had to have animal control take away like<br />30 cats. I swear to god I had no idea she had that many, I thought she<br />had like maybe two or three. Anyway, last summer I had another tenant<br />who was even more fucked in the head. I can only tell you my half of<br />this story, which I assure you is fucked up enough as it is.<br /><br />So I get a call while I'm at a bar late Friday night from one of my<br />tenants. Apparently they were alarmed at a &quot;decaying odor&quot; emanating<br />from the unit next to theirs. I knew the guy living in it, he was<br />really old so my first thought is the guy had died or something and<br />the smell was his body (morbid, I know...). I was too drunk to drive<br />so I had a friend give me a ride back to my place. I asked my friend<br />if he wanted to come with me to check on the guy and he basically told<br />me to fuck off and that he didn't want to see a dead body. I thought<br />&quot;Who doesn't want to see a dead body?&quot; ... I guess he wasn't as drunk<br />as I was. I told him to wait in the car for a few minutes, which he<br />agreed to. Looking back on it, I really should have made him come with<br />me. So I go up to the guys door and knock a few times, yell &quot;Mr.<br />Sherman are you okay? I'm coming in to check on you&quot; (That's not his<br />real name obviously). Of course, I get no response so I unlock his<br />door and head on in.<br /><br />The smell hit my sinuses like a brick in the face. I've gutted Moose<br />before so I know a bad smell when I smell it. This was... well it was<br />about the same smell really. That is to say, it smelled more than<br />enough for me to believe there was a dead body somewhere in there.<br />Still, I had to make sure before I called the police. I didn't want to<br />call them in on a week old pot roast, or because the refrigerator was<br />left open or something. So I went about exploring the apartment. I<br />knew the layout already (most of the units are the same), so I began<br />to search the apartment room by room whilst holding my t-shirt over my<br />face to keep myself from gagging. The living room (the first room you<br />see when you enter) was surprisingly neat and clean. There were a<br />bunch of books on the coffee table lined up in a neat stack, and the<br />telephone was on the cabinet by the wall where it should be. Then I<br />looked at the corner and reflexively let out a &quot;SHIT!&quot; and backed up.<br />There was a dog staring at me. It looked like a little black terrier,<br />the &quot;Scotty&quot; kind. It wasn't growling or anything so I thought he was<br />just scared, then started laughing at myself for being afraid of it.<br />It still wasn't moving. I was a little creeped out by how much time<br />had passed and it still wasn't moving. I though &quot;Naw, couldn't be...&quot;,<br />but sure enough, it was stuffed. The dude had a stuffed Scottish<br />terrier in his living room. Weird. I was still in a good mood at this<br />point, had to chuckle to myself over getting afraid of a stuffed dog.<br />I turned to my left and walked into the kitchen/kitchenette.<br />The kitchen was a little bit messy; I could tell someone actually used<br />this part of the apartment. There were just a couple knives in the<br />sink, and the counter had some crumbs on it and stuff. I opened the<br />refrigerator up, hoping to god that was where the smell was coming<br />from. Nope, the refrigerator was completely empty. It looked like the<br />guy hardly even used the apartment; there were almost no personal<br />belongings in the living room or kitchen except for a couple plates<br />(that came with the place), and the weird ass stuffed dog in the<br />living room. So I went back into the living room and HOLY SHIT THE DOG<br />HAD MOVED. Actually, it didn't... there was a second dog behind the<br />couch that I hadn't noticed the first time. Still, it almost gave me a<br />heart attack. This weirdo guy had two stuffed dogs in his living room<br />both watching in different directions. The second dog was not a<br />terrier by the way, it was a little shitzu or some long haired little<br />foofoo dog I don't know what they're all called. Needless to say, I<br />was WTF-ing pretty hard at this point and my heart was beating so fast<br />I could hear it in my ears.<br /><br /><br />Anyway I worked myself up a bit and went down the hallway and checked<br />a closet. Nope, empty. The smell was definitely getting stronger now.<br />Next up was the first bedroom. The smell wasn't so strong in there so<br />I didn't think I was going to find anything. (I should probably point<br />out by now that I had turned on all the lights in the place. I wasn't<br />retarded going around with a flashlight or something. The neighborhood<br />is not so good around here so I'm always on guard for people jumping<br />out and attacking me at night). So I flick on the light in the<br />bedroom, and it's pretty fucked up. The mattress had been taken off of<br />the bed, and the sheets were all torn up. There were a shit load of<br />holes and scratches in the wall, which were at chest level so they<br />were most likely from punching and/or scraping with a knife or<br />something. Most disturbingly, there was a shit load of red stains on<br />the carpet. They looked a lot like wine stains, (remember, I was<br />drunk) so blood was not the first thing to pop in my mind (It actually<br />was blood. I was an idiot). All I remember thinking at this point is<br />&quot;Forget about the deposit, this guy is going to get charged out the<br />ass&quot;. The whole experience of being in this apartment was starting to<br />get at me though. Every room I went into I was half expecting to find<br />a dead body so I just wanted to find the source of that smell then get<br />the fuck out of there. So I went into the bathroom and there was a fur<br />carpet in there. Except it wasn't a carpet, it was like 20 different<br />little furs all laid out on the floor. They were mostly brown and<br />black, but there were a couple white ones. I couldn't tell if they<br />smelled bad, but they were definitely not the main source.<br />I went down the hall to the second bedroom, timidly muttering stuff<br />like &quot;Mr. Sherman, are you in here?&quot;. I started out in a good mood but<br />after getting startled that hard twice in a row my adrenaline was<br />going. Shit felt like a horror movie. Anyway, I went into the bedroom<br />and sure enough, there was a dead body. He was lying face down on his<br />bed with his knees on the floor and his pants off, ass bare and<br />pointed straight at the doorway (at me). Anyway, I got the fuck out at<br />that point and told my friend in the car what I saw. Of course, he<br />didn't believe me until the police I called showed up.<br /><br /><br />I never got to see the worst part, one of the cops told me about it.<br />Apparently this dude was a veterinarian and had been taking home all<br />the dead bodies of animals he'd put down. He had made a fetish of<br />skinning them all and just throwing the skinned bodies into the tub in<br />the second bathroom. I guess the first bathroom was too good for that<br />so that's where he kept the furs. The worst of the worst part is that<br />the guy died from a heart attack while jerking it with the intestines<br />of one of the animals. Apparently he had made a fetish of using their<br />guts as jerk off sleeves and just let them pile up in the bath tub<br />after he was done with them. In the end, the deposit ($500) didn't<br />begin to cover the damage to the apartment, let alone the emotional<br />damage he did to the apartment manager (me).<br /><br /><br />Yup, I hate my job.</div></blockquote></div>
