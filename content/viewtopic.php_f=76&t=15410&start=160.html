Not $800B stimulus packages that cost $1MM per job created. <br /><br />I know I'm side-stepping the question slightly, but I view taxes and spending along a continuum. There are efficient taxes that tax behavior we don't mind reducing (ie. cigarette taxes, gas taxes) and there are inefficient taxes that distort incentives and hurt the economy (high corporate taxes). With spending, there is a whole continuum of spending with varying degrees of efficacy, and it can be evaluated by how effective it is at creating the outcomes you want. Defense spending (how efficient is X program at making us safer), social spending (how effective is Y program at improving outcomes of the recipients), healthcare spending (how effective is Z program at improving health and happiness).</div>

			<div class="content">My mom was raised by a single parent.  Well, technically a widow since her dad died in the coal mines 2 months before she was born.  They lived in what was called a &quot;company house&quot;, essentially a 2 room shack with no indoor plumbing or furnace.  Her only toys were what her uncle brought home from &quot;work&quot;... he was what was known as a &quot;rag man&quot;, after being injured in the mines, he earned money by going around the neighboorhood collecting old clothes to sell as rags, junk to fix and sell, etc.  Back then (1940s-50s), there were no welfare or assistance programs, so she dropped out of school after 8th grade to get a job with her mom doing &quot;piece work&quot; in the clothes factory at 1 cent per.<br /><br />I guess I don't really have a point as she does have fond childhood memories, like the chickens they raised for food, etc.</div>
