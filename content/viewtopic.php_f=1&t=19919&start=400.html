Neshak Hunter and Robertson all won’t be pitching and we didn’t really replace them. So yeah there won’t be that many injuries but there will probably be some and we’ll feel the heat earlier. <br /><br />Plus as it stands right now we have either VVor Pivetta in the rotation and we’re one injury from both.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Don't worry, it was all bad luck. Everyone will be healthy and the starters will finally put it together despite their history of failure. Remember those 3 games by Pivetta after the demotion? He's ready, baby.<br /><br />And the Braves team will all suddenly get worse, even though they are younger. Their farm will suddenly stop producing and we'll forge diamonds in our system out of coal.<br /><br />History to date has been an aberration, an unhappy and unlucky coincidence.  Klentak will make the move to end all moves at the deadline and save the day.</div></blockquote><br /><br />lol.. you're gold.<br /><br />Your original post makes all sorts of assertions, and you offer no evidence.  Now, it's all snarky straw man bullshit.  Do some work, don't just be a WIP caller.<br /><br />Pivetta's not even in the rotation at this point.  Their &quot;history of failure&quot; rotation includes Aaron Nola, Zack Wheeler, and Jake Arrieta (who I fucking hate but doesn't have a history of failure any longer than Zack Eflin's history of success.   The Phillies lineup, overall, was younger than the Braves (27.6 average per PA vs 28.1), despite your gut.  Atlanta won 97 games despite a run differential that supports 91 wins.   Their 2 best hitters are over 30, and one may leave.  Thus, not developing, and likely to win less.  But, hey, Acuna is 22 so he'll get better because development curves apply equally to everyone, like Andruw Jones.  <br /><br />But you're not interested in evidence, you're interested in emotion and gloom, and making it personal.  So enjoy.</div></blockquote><br /><br />3 of our current 5 starters have a recent history of failure or have never been good. I'm obviously not referring to Nola or wheeler. The Braves lineup is older because of Freeman and Donaldson skewing the numbers. They have more young producers than we do. And their young guys are MUCH better than ours. 91 wins are 10 more than we won and we had a run differential that should have won us even fewer. Atlanta may be likely to win less because 97 wins is difficult to repeat, but they are still much better than us on paper. We are likely to win more, but not 10 games more, especially with the run differential where it was.<br /><br />I really don't know what to say. We haven't been NEARLY as good as them the past two years, but you seem to suggest that was bad luck and we actually have a good chance of beating them. It's not going WIP to suggest that might be incorrect analysis. We added one good starter and a SS that produced poorly last season coming off an injury. The Braves may be losing their solid 3B, or they may not, and they have a farm that seems able to plug any holes. I honestly don't understand how you are seeing what you see.<br /><br />Sorry for the sarcasm in my previous post, especially after your nice posts. I wouldn't have done that if I had seen your nice post. But you have to admit you have not been very nice to me over the years. There's been lots of sarcasm and snark. But I would welcome a more cordial back and forth. I agree with your posts much more often than not, and I don't think I'm nearly as negative as you think. I tend yo post my negative thoughts and keep the more positive thoughts to myself at times. That's a very bad habit. I seem to enjoy playing devil's advocate too much. It's my fatal board flaw. I'm honestly not like that IRL.</div>

			<div class="content">I've decided that Deivy Grullon should be our backup C.  Knapp blows, and Grullon can hit a little.  I think he'd be a league-average hitter.    Knapp is replacement-level defined, and that's what we should do with him... replace him.<br /><br />Also, Scott Kingery will play 2B, hit 24 homers, and generally look a lot more like 2017 minor league, and 2019 first-half major league Kingery.<br /><br />I want Dickerson or Miller or both back.  <br /><br />I think there's still some value on the non-tender scrap heap out there, too, pitching-wise.  Taijuan Walker, Aaaron Sanchez, Jimmy Nelson... maybe some others.  I'd like to sign one, or more.  <br /><br />I'm ready for baseball.  Fantasy football is driving me crazy (My 12-1 team may lose in the semis to Jamison Crowder), but my 5-9 team that got into the playoffs because of a &quot;most points&quot; wildcard may win it all because Lamar Jackson.   Let's end this weekly misery, and get back to baseball.</div>

			<div class="content">For me, a lot depends on Price. Young was a disaster as the PC.  Kranitz looked to be on the verge of getting something out of Eflin, Pivetta and even VV. Then he was canned and along came last season and, with Young, they all went into the tank. After what he did in August and September, Eflin definitely looks salvageable. Maybe Price can work some magic with Pivetta and/or VV? Their problems may be more between their ears than their arms.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Shore wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>Making up as many games as we need to make up, and with 3 teams ahead of us, is also a lot of wishful thinking. Nearly everything would have to go well and the other teams would need to have their luck drop. It's hard to make up that many games. <br /><br />I'm not saying we weren't unlucky, we certainly were, but that bad luck carries into this year to a certain extent because those injured players have to come back healthy. The two years are not completely independent events. It's not like rolling the dice two separate times.<br /><br />Plus, maybe some of what appeared to be bad luck was actually bad design. I would guess that's almost certainly the case.<br /><br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the collection we have at 3B, SS, and 2B, as a unit, is going to be one of the worst in the league this year offensively. And we have no idea what we'll get out of Haseley in CF or if Cutch will come back at full strength. That's a lot of ifs on a team that needs to make up a lot of ground. And that's before we even start to talk about the pitching. <br /><br />Add to that, the Braves core should be getting better, not worse. They were lucky with injuries last year, but any drop off in that department should be offset by the core developing. <br /><br />Looks to me like we are taking a longshot flier to sneak into a WC spot. That rarely turns out well.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I disagree with most of this... <br /><br />While they aren't independent events, the league is full of guys who get hurt one year, and not the next, and vice versa.  It's not like we're banking on a series of guys who are frequently hurt, and can expect more of the same this year.  We had young guys, old guys, guys who'd almost never been hurt... all of them down last year.  And we shed many of them, so this group's health this year is fairly independent of last year's group's health last year.<br /><br />As far as bad design, we were unlucky, not poorly designed.  We lost 8 of 9 relievers.  David Robertson was an absolute iron man - 60 to 70 games, 60 to 70 innings, 9 straight years.  We get 6 innings.  Hunter, similar.  Seranthony was a godsend in 2018 - no reason to expect him to go down.  Neshek was a gamble, but you make some bets.  It was trash luck, pure and simple, unless our trainers were doing some bizarre experiments that ruined everyone's arm all at once.<br /><br />As far as the 2B/SS/3B group, we got about  .740 OPS out of that group last year, which was below average, but not far below (about 25 points).  The worst offender, Franco, is gone, and Cesar was dead-on average for the group.  Segura had his worst year in 4 years, was better than the other 2, and remains.  Gregorius has a .778 OPS over the last 4 years, including last year's post-injury .718.  Assuming Kingery is the last of the group, I don't see how we're not better offensively this year than last, which would put us at least league average.  A little rebound from both Segura and Gregorius, and a little development from Kingery, and they could be top 10 or 12 in the majors, offensively, at those positions. <br /><br />Atlanta's best hitter was Freddie Freeman, who's 30 - he's not improving.  2nd best was Josh Donaldson, who's 33, and a free agent.  Their best player is Acuna, who is amazing and only 22, but I don't think he's a normal career arc kind of guy - he's not going to decisively improve through his age 27 season... he'll tighten up his weaknesses (strikeouts), probably walk more, but he's already a star, as is Albies.  Dansby Swanson and the rest of their lineup are scrubs.   Soroka's another one who experienced great success at an early age, but I don't think he has much, if any, improvement in him.  They do have a ton of arms in their system, so that's a huge problem.  But they're a very good team, not a great team, and I don't think they're &quot;developing&quot; at all.  I'd expect fewer wins from them in 2020, assuming they don't land Bryant.<br /><br />I don't think our plan is &quot;take a longshot flier to sneak into a WC spot&quot;.  Our plan, to me, is to realistically evaluate what we have on the field over the first 50-80 games, and then decide whether to make a splash and go for it, or to wait until 2021 to go for it.  Given a new manager, a new pitching coach, a big FA pitcher, a mostly new infield, the return of several injured guys - the plan makes sense.  Let Girardi have input as to the club's makeup, see who's performing and who isn't, and who's available to fix things.  If we're 5 games out of 1st, but Arrieta is 2-8 with a 6 ERA, go get Kluber/Ray/whatever because you can realistically expect to make a difference there.  If one of the IF isn't working out, and Lindor/Bryant/Arenado are on the market, go for it.  <br /><br />Shooting your shot now, with this team, isn't the brightest idea.  Wait, despite the WIP agony it will bring.</div></blockquote><br /><br />When you have guys coming off TJ surgery and other elbow injuries, there is a fair likelihood that some of them will not perform to expectations or will have setbacks from their surgeries. Some of them will get injured again, almost certainly. If you are saying that relief pitcher performance tends to fluctuate from year to year, then I agree with you. But the roster as currently contructed is banking on a lot of guys to come back and be at the top of their games. Maybe we have the numbers to overcome that, I don't know. Cutch is another guy who has to come back healthy and I wasn't just talking about the relief pitchers. Given his age, it's possible he will not be himself coming back from surgery. He had a major injury and it's hard to tel what will happen. I'm optimistic, but we also need some realism in there, too. Taken together, we are hoping for a lot of our top guys to come back from major injuries (Cutch, seranthony, <span style="font-weight: bold">Roberts</span>) and perform at the level that they were before injury. Chances are some of those long list of injured will have continuing problems. Some will not. I'm concerned we seem to be counting on them. Two causes for optimism is that Cutch's game depends more on OBP and power, which may not be affected much by any lingering issues. And relief pitching is probably the easiest commodity to find during the season, either from within or outside the organization. <br /><br />You don't know it wasn't bad design. You are blowing smoke and completely relying on your own analysis. We were relying on several pitchers who never pitched at a high level at ML level to do just that. Pivetta, VZ, Eflin... we were relying on not just one of them to pitch well, but pretty much all of them to pitch well. We were also relying on Kingery, who was terrible the year before and pretty bad after the all star break last year, to suddenly put it together. We were relying on Franco to put it together, finally. We needed most of those things to happen to catch a young brave team and somehow also catch the Nats. That sounds like bad design to me. We did ALSO get unlucky with injuries, but we were hoping for a lot of good things to happen. Too much hoping, IMO, just like this year appears to be.<br /><br />Plus, this is what I said. I acknowledged the bad luck, but said there was most likely some bad design as well. Given what I posted in the previous paragraph of this post, I stand by that.<br /><br />&quot;Plus, maybe some of what appeared to be bad luck was actually bad design. I would guess that's almost certainly the case.&quot;<br /><br />Yeh, I stand by that. Lots of bad luck with injuries, plus some bad design. I think that's a fair assessment.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">So we were below average last year</span> and replaced Franco with Gregorius, who wasn't really better than Franco last year. And we replaced Hernandez, who was average, with Kingery, who was below average. But we are going to be better this year, and maybe a good bit better if everything falls right. Got it. Wishcasting. <br /><br />For the record, I really like Gregorius as a SS. I think it's a very good signing. Move Segura to 2B and leave Kingery as the UTIL. If Kingery's 1st half from last year becomes the norm,  then let him play CF. Go get a 3B. I don't see how the IF isn't the same or worse unless we get fairly lucky with Gregorius or we get a 3B. I think we REALLY need a 3B.<br /><br />Atlanta is a very young team with an excellent farm and everyone they bring up seems to produce. freeman is older and they MAY have lost Dolaldson, but I don't see how you can say they are not a developing team. They have arms out the ears and their core is at the age that tends to improve. Some won't, but the arc of a player's career tends to improve until the mid to late 20s, which you acknowledge.<br /><br />If the plan is to make a splash later in the summer if they are in the race, maybe that will work. But I'm pretty sure the games early in the year count the same as the games after the AS break. If you sacrifice games now, you are less likely to make the playoffs. That's pretty simple. They are hoping to see if everything goes well and then go for it later if things do go well. That seems like we're taking a longshot flier, imo. Maybe you disagree. But what you describe sounds like a longshot to me.<br /><br />Plus, segrura and Harper will be another year older and Realmuto may or may not be here after this year. And I don't exactly see a cavalry coming over the hill.</div></blockquote><br /><br />If by Roberts you mean Robertson, I don't think anyone is expecting him to even pitch in 2020, let alone at the level he was before...<br /><br />When you said we were below average last year, at first I thought you meant the team as a whole. 81-81 is the very definition of average, albeit below expectations. Then I realized, maybe you just meant the infield. If you don't think Segura(if he returns to his averages of the prior 3-4 yrs/Didi(if he returns to his pre-TJS levels/Kingery(w another under his belt) isn't an improvement over Cesar/Segura/Franco, I don't know what to tell you. Should be at least 2-3 win improvement there. Girardi should be worth 3 wins over Kapler. Wheeler should be worth at least 2 wins over VV/Pivetta. Nola, and most of other pitchers, should be better in 2020 than 2019 simply by having a real pitching coach. Hoskins should be better almost by default(can't wait to see what Dillon does with him). Would I like to see another SP, a 3B, and a couple RP? Hell yeah! But this team is already much better than last year, and it's not even Christmas yet!<br /><br />And Shore is not usually pie-in-the-sky overly positive, so if he's on board with the direction this team's heading, I guess I can come along for the ride.</div>

Too many ifs for my liking. If all that stuff happens, of course they will be better. I don't dispute that. What I dispute is the likelihood that all those ifs will happen at once. When a bunch of ifs happen all at once, it's called luck.<br /><br />Hoskins should be better? Probably. The manager is worth 3 more games? Doubt it. The pitching and hitting coaches will turn a bunch of players around who have long histories of not being that good? Again, I doubt it.<br /><br />I like Eflin. I like the Gregorius signing (I think he's one of the places where we could see a big upgrade). I think Hoskins and Nola will be better. I think the bullpen will be better because it can't be worse and the injury luck was terrible. I think the collection of the other guys will be a bit better because none of them were great last year and at least one player will probably take a major step forward. Hopefully Harper and Hoskins and Nola and realmuto stay healthy. But add all that up and we still probably don't make up 16 games on the Braves, even if they come back to us a good bit. The two WC places help, so maybe we can slip in there with 86-88 wins. I think that's our upside right now if things go right. I would still like them to add a legit 3B and another starter because I think we need them to get a little more certainty in those 86-88 wins.</div>

			<div class="content">Very good discussion in my opinion.<br /><br />To get into division contention with the other three teams projected to contend, I agree that we need to add some upgrades, and the upgrades need to be 2+ WAR upgrades, not 1 WAR (or less).  The problem with this is that those 2+ WAR guys will cost money (or be very lucky pick-ups).  Relievers aren't generally worth more than about 1 WAR, so those acquisitions won't help much.  And unless they can dump Robertson's or Herrera's contract (or both), they are going to have to bust the cap to get a couple of 2+ WAR upgrades.  And, at least in the press, it doesn't seem like they're willing to bust the cap.<br /><br />I guess 3B, SP, and CF are the positions where a 2+ WAR improvement is possible due to our own weakness there in 2019 (replacement level or worse last year, projected better this season).  <br /><br />The one thing that would really add cheap WAR is if Haseley, Howard, and Bohm could be those upgrades...if those guys could produce 2+ WAR seasons, we could contend.  Counting on three guys that young and inexperienced has not been successful often, historically, but it's not unheard of.  Will be looking forward to finding out!</div>

Should be at least 2-3 win improvement there. Girardi should be worth 3 wins over Kapler. Wheeler should be worth at least 2 wins over VV/Pivetta. Nola, and most of other pitchers, should be better in 2020 than 2019 simply by having a real pitching coach. Hoskins should be better almost by default(can't wait to see what Dillon does with him). Would I like to see another SP, a 3B, and a couple RP? Hell yeah! But this team is already much better than last year, and it's not even Christmas yet!<br /><br />And Shore is not usually pie-in-the-sky overly positive, so if he's on board with the direction this team's heading, I guess I can come along for the ride.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />If...If...If....

Positive regression SHOULD result in an improvement, it's just a question of how much. Plus the additions on the field and in the dugout...</div>

			<div class="content">we added one player that should be a significant addition, Stripes.  <br /><br />I think it's hard to add wins, much harder than you seem to think it is. The difference between Harper and a replacement level player was only 4 games. You're lucky if you can add one game at about half your positions from year to year. That's 4 games. The difference between Nola and Pivetta was about 4 games. To make up 16 games, you need to have multiple huge upgrades or small upgrades all over the place. It's really hard to do. I do think the Braves won't win 97 games again, but even if they drop to the low 90's, we still need to gain 10 games, and that's without counting our lucky run differential.  The upgrades you mention will not be enough to do that and it's unlikely all those upgrades will happen while the Braves also drop 6 or so games. <br /><br />Plus, we have to hope the Mets and/or Nats don't get better. We aren't the only one that had a bad bullpen last year that might improve this year. The Nats had the worst bullpen in baseball last year. Do you think they might be a good bet to improve on those numbers? The Mets were 25th. You think they might improve? We were 16th and the Braves were 11th. For all the talk of our terrible bullpen that we should be able to improve just by getting people healthy, we were right in the middle of the pack last year. The Mets and Nats have more room for improvement there than we do.<br /><br />I totally agree that we had some really bad luck last year, but even if that luck returns to even, we still won't improve 10 games, even with the Wheeler addition. Maybe we'll get lucky this time instead of unlucky. If that happens, we should be right there for the wildcard or maybe the division. But the odds are against it. <br /><br />This reminds me of when Pivetta came up after his demotion and pitched well for 3 games. A lot of people said he was fixed or that he was likely to continue pitching well. I was certainly hoping for that to happen, but I said that it was unlikely a switch had suddenly turned on, and it was more likely that it was a small sample size improvement. I was criticized for that, but I was just playing the odds. I think that's what I'm doing here.</div>
