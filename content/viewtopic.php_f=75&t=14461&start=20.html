			<div class="content">This is right on. DeGaulle was literally the only French officer who understood what the Germans were up to and tried to emulate their doctrine and training. As you correctly state, the French authorities generally told him to piss up a rope. That being said, the French Char (tank) models were superior in armor and armament to the Germans...but they were designed to fight as infantry support weapons, not as part of a mobile combined arms team. <br /><br />The Germans started to examine their performance in 1921, under Von Seeckt, the Chief of Staff. He was ruthless in his approach to finding out what went wrong and began to drive a new doctrine and training regiment using the strosstruppen tactics as a start. <br /><br />The British deliberately ignored what occurred in WWI until I think 1928 or 1929. I think they were afraid to reflect on how piss poor their performance was, especially those of the senior field commanders. Interestingly enough, the British starting experimenting with mobile warfare doctrine and mobile combined arms teams as early as 1927. In fact, every major power sent observers to the Salisbury Plain to watch the British Armored Brigade conduct operations. Unfortunately for the British, they had to make a decision....they had to choose from a witches menu...<br /><br />The British first had to choose what service to fund and resource. The British Navy had built the Empire, it would remain fully funded. The fledgling Royal Air Force was tasked to defend the British mainland; the political and royal powers were not pleased that the Germans could launch zeppelin and then bomber raids (I've actually been to the spot where the first German night bomber raid was conducted)...the RAF had to be given a lot of money to ensure the protection of the British cities and people. That left the Army...and the discussion was either to have an expeditionary force like the one that was created in 1914, or to have a colonial police force to monitor the Empire's possessions. They kept the colonial policing force and let the remnants of World War One army slowly fester, poorly funded and resourced, and unwilling and probably unable to recreate itself after the bleeding of World War One. <br /><br />A serious historian friend of mine, an American, has said that the Allies winning in World War One was the best thing that could have happened to America, and the worst thing that could have happened to the rest of the world. I suspect he is correct in his perspective.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Luzinski's Gut wrote:</cite>There's an excellent book by Robert Citino called The Quest for Decisive Victory which describes the period between 1870 and 1939.<br /><br />Gotta run. Will write more later.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Awesome posts like this probably explain why I never quite can bring myself to quit BSG. Thanks. <br /><br />I think it could be said that the worst thing for the Allies militarily in WWII was winning WWI. The victory, which I think was mostly a matter of the infusion of American resources allowing them to outlast the Central Powers, meant that they didn't seriously re-evaluate after the war. De Gaulle I believe had a clue about mobile warfare in the '30s, but I gather was such an asshat that they essentially benched him for most of the interwar period.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Been a few yrs since I read it, but you guys might find Niall Ferguson's The Pity of War worthwhile. It covers a lot of the ground from this thread, plus a crap ton of economic analysis of the two sides before and during the war. <br /><br />Another point on DeGaulle... some of you probably know that he spent most of WWI as an involuntary guest of the Germans.  He escaped something like six times, and was recaptured every time owing to the difficulty of hiding when you're 6 1/2 feet tall with a nose visible from space. IMO this is both hilarious and maybe tragic, in that perhaps the high brass would have had to listen to him later if he'd stayed in the field and distinguished himself.</div>

I believe he had a pretty decent argument that the post-war stuff would have been less catastrophic to the world had we and the krauts teamed up and made the peace treaty.  <br /><br />It was interesting at the time especially since we were facing a huge Godless Red Army and their sub-human allies at the time.  Plus they had all those sneaky KGB spies everywhere (have you watched the Americans on FX yet?).  Part of us were like, you know this Cold War/Nuclear weapon mutually assured destruction kinda sucks and maybe a post war world developed by the American-German victors would have worked out better.  Further, the Middle East may well have turned out better somehow without the Brits and French screwing stuff up there.  (We still wanted Israel to exist though so not sure how that wouldda worked).</div>

			<div class="content">It's an interesting theory and I'm not sure I disagree. But probably the bigger determinant would have had to do with the nature of the peace, whoever won. The Germans had a legitimate beef in that they were forced to terms totally out of whack with what happened militarily. Public opinion in England and France demanded this, and Wilson (whom I view far more as tragic than evil) couldn't sway them. <br /><br />There was enough proto-fascist stuff swirling around in all of central/western Europe that I suspect there would have been a problem at some point. Unless you think the economic collapse itself wasn't inevitable; take that out of the equation and maybe things turn out ok.</div>

			<div class="content">Let's get back to Smitty's original assertion on the Peace of 1919. <br /><br />The Allies, specifically England and France, were out for blood. They had been bled white, from an economic and manpower perspective. They saw the Germans as the root cause of the issue - although there is probably an argument that the Byzantine secret treaties of the pre-war period was just as responsible. They were not going to settle for any kind of compromise, despite the fact they really had not beaten the Germans. The Germans had been starved to death by the naval blockades...the Army capitulated in the field because the government had exhausted its resources trying to feed the people. <br /><br />The Italians - and the book The White War goes into great detail about this (and I have to give it large props, it is the best book on WWI from the Italian perspective) - were out of their mind. They were Allies, but had been involved in a stalemate against the Austro-Hungarians (I think there were 12 battles there) and the Germans sent two or three corps there to reinforce them...and ended up pushing the Italians 50 miles outside of Venice before their offensive was exhausted. Well, the Italians, despite having almost no juice, demanded that they were given territory on the EASTERN SIDE of the Adriatic along the Dalmatian coast as war reparations against the Austro-Hungarians. Well, since that Empire collapsed into the polymorphous mess known as the Balkans, there was no representation to really argue against the Italians. <br /><br />The Russians were ass deep in the middle of a civil war, one that sent at least two American infantry regiments into Russia to actually fight the Communists. The ones I know about were sent to the Arcangel area in the Kola Peninsula, and another was sent along the Trans-Siberian railroad to fight with the Japanese and White Russians. The Russians actually managed to defeat the White Armies - a miracle in itself - and then decided to attack the Poles in 1920. Well, the Poles just received their independence for the first time since the Middle Ages, and they allowed the Russians to penetrate deeply into the heartland, and then counterattacked and destroyed an entire Soviet Red Army. <br /><br />The American, led by the hapless Woodrow Wilson, the utterly corrupt Ed House and the ambitious Henry Cabot Lodge, were pushing the 14 Points program as well as the League of Nations. Wilson, this hapless schmuck, didn't even see if his own country would approve these new programs...and they didn't. The Democrats formed a block of German and Irish representatives that effectively blocked the passage, and Wilson's pride wouldn't allow for compromise. Wilson was also completely powerless to stop Clemenceau, the French minister, and Lloyd George, the British minister, from pushing for reparations. <br /><br />The Turks were forgotten about as the Ottoman Empire effectively died. Mustafa Ataturk ended up being the first President of Turkey after a three civil war. <br /><br />The French and to lesser extent, British economic demands directly led to the German hyperinflation and economic collapse. In the fantastic book, When Money Dies, Adam Fergusson shows how the French kept hounding the Germans for payment on schedule, and how the German politicians were not able to keep employment high without devaluing the currency. This leads to the French and British continuing to occupy the Saar until 1935; the Saar is the industrial center of Germany at this time, with the steel and coal mills in full force. This led to the Germans becoming more radical, even after the &quot;Stabbed in the Back&quot; theory was going full bore...there was widespread terrorism by German nationalists. The Saar issue became a strong narrative with the National Socialists as well...<br /><br />The point of war, we are taught at the School of Advanced Military Studies, is to provide for a better peace. The Peace of Versailles was nothing close to a fair peace; in fact, Marshal Foch of the French Army said &quot;This is not a peace, this is an armistice for twenty years after the Treaty was signed. The bitter resentment of the French and British - again, completely logical and understandable from their perspective - laid the foundations for another war with more radical ideologues in charge of the German and Russian countries...and the result was over 50 million dead. <br /><br />World War One was the biggest debacle of modern Western Civilization. It was the first shot to the side of the head of the European powers, World War Two delivered a few more, and the Cold War finished them off completely. To me, it is fascinating to see the linkages back into this time period...as today we see Germany being the strongest economic power in Europe, with de facto control over the European Union.</div>

But at least that wasn't intentional. Apparently, the outbreak began at an Army base in Kansas. So, US entry ended the war, but at a price of 50 million more lives.</div>

But it doesn't much go into postwar politics. Its focus is the British, and spends a great deal of time on the British left and pacifist movements. It also discusses how the Boer War was a kind of prelude to total war, a war without rules that made little distinction between soldier and civilian. <br /><br />I don't know much about history curricula, but my sense is that WWI is under-emphasized. I'm in the beginning phases of some research on Anglo-American political thought of the late 40s through the early 60s, but I think that story really starts with WWI. Bertrand Russell's involvement in the British anti-war movement is perhaps where I'll start as prologue.</div>
