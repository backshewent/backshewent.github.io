<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>When President Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich stirred its own controversy back in 2001, former President Clinton took the forthright step of waiving Executive Privilege and permitting some of his closest aides to testify about the facts of the matter. On March 1, 2001, President Clinton's former Chief of Staff John Podesta, his former Counsel Beth Nolan, and one of his closest counselors Bruce Lindsay testified before Chairman Burton's House Government Reform Committee on this matter. As Chairman Burton acknowledged in his opening statement: &quot;We asked the president not to claim executive privilege so his aides could testify, and he's done that, and that's a positive step.&quot; (Transcript of March 1, 2001 hearing of the House Government Reform Committee.)</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I'm starting to like the fact that Libby's clemency is being compared with Clinton's pardons.</div>

They were right. Mark Rich (represented by Scooter Libby, btw) never should have been pardoned.

HOWEVER, to say that the current abuse has its roots in Clinton's behavior is ridiculous.  How many things has the Bush administration done over the last 6 years that have no roots in anything that Clinton did?  The Bush administration has done plenty of rule/law breaking/bending to conclude that they are not too concerned with precedent when it comes to making decisions on how to use executive power.  Do you seriously think that had Clinton not pardoned Marc Rich that Bush would not have pardoned Libby?  I think that is a major stretch of the imagination.  </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I wouldn't make that very reductionist argument. But I do believe that the Clintons created an environment in which the media, and the public, came to more easily accept baldly political actions. 
<br />
<br />What I hate more than anything else about the Bush Gang is their transparent belief that government isn't about serving the public, but merely a tool to reward friends and punish enemies. I believe--as you evidently don't--that there was a tiny glimmer of this view inherernt in the Clinton administration. 
<br />
<br />Did Bill Clinton always act this way? Of course not; he appointed Republicans to important Cabinet positions, and even worked with the Gingrich Congress--which was far more rabidly partisan--on issues aside from those for which they tried to stage a coup against him. 
<br />
<br />But if you read Sidney Blumenthal's memoir (a really good read, btw) and other statements from key figures in that period, it's clear that political considerations were unusually, maybe unprecedentedly, important. I do think this helped set the stage, just a little, for the total politicization and shameless self-dealing of the Bush years.</div>

<br />
<br />Please tell me what I wrote that suggested I believe that politics were not very important to the Clinton White House.  I don't think that I did ever suggest that but perhaps I wrote something that I should re-write.  
<br />
<br />My objection to your argument is the causality (the Clinton WH politicization set the stage for Bush politicization) not the assertion that there <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> politicization in the Clinton WH.  The Clintons may have upped the ante as far as politicization went, but the Bush administration has gone so far in this direction and politicized its activities to such a degree that I don't see any evidence that they have been concerned at all about what any other administration has or has not done.  Cheney and Rove were going to do what they set out to do without reference to how far the Clintons involved politics in their decisions.  
<br />
<br />Yes the administration defenders like to point to things that Clinton did to justify Bush's actions, but I see this as post-hoc red herring argument that is often successful.  Frankly, I think you fell for it.  This is a very typical play in the playbook:  (1) Bush does something bad, (2) his supporters mitigate the negative reaction to Bush by getting people to think about (and argue about) the bad things that Clinton did years ago instead of focusing in on what Bush is doing right now, (3) Bush's actions don't seem as bad.  It usually works.  They did it with wire tapping, they did it about Bin Laden, they did it with Saddam, etc.  That doesn't mean that Clinton didn't do bad things or things worthy of criticism, but the reason for bringing them up isn't to explain why Bush is doing something but to distract from what he is doing.  
<br />
<br />I would have preferred that Clinton never pardoned Rich and this was not a convenient talking point to use to justify the Libby commutation, but that does not mean that the Rich pardon justifies Bush's actions or had anything to do with them in a causal way, even slightly.  
<br />
<br />It may be reductionistic, but if you believe that Bush would still have commuted Libby's sentence even if Marc Rich was still a fugitive, then bringing up Bill Clinton is just an irrelevant distraction...unless you are looking for a precedent in how a controversial pardon should be dealt with by congress, the justice department and the administration.  In this case, that would mean a full investigation that included Bush releasing key personnel from the clam of executive privilege in order to testify.</div>

It usually works.

<br />
<br />Whether or not &quot;I fell for it&quot; isn't important, and misses my point. That point was whether the Clinton-era politicization helped create a context in which wastes of oxygen like Chris Matthews could, if they so chose, justify the excesses and arguable crimes of the Bush Gang--in other words, if Clinton's own actions enabled the Fourth Estate to &quot;fall for it.&quot; I say yes. 
<br />
<br />Looking forward as well as backward, what bothers me even more about a Clinton Restoration is that I think Sen. Clinton would have a similarly broad view of Presidential Superpowers that Bush and his merry band of hacks and nutjobs have shown.

One of my main disappointments with Clinton was the fodder he provided for right wing talking points, so I agree with you there.  <br /><br />However, I think that the strategy of the right is to scream loudly and relentlessly whenever any Democratic politician does <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> so that they can keep the media repeating their attacks and distract everyone from the behavior of their politicians.  I think that the attention that Clinton gets is a symptom of this, not the cause.  I think that Clinton gets a lot of attention because he was a very successful politician, not because his behavior warrants it.  <br /><br />I think discussing what Clinton did wrong and why these are good reasons to not vote for Hillary is entirely appropriate.  However, I think that discussing them in relation to creating an atmosphere for Bush to do what he wants is not appropriate and plays into the hands of those who want Bush to get away with everything.  Look at the way that Gore and Kerry were treated by the media.  The media were all too happy to treat them like monsters because they were pushed by the right wing.  The media also likes to go after Clinton for fictitious things all the time.  <br /><br />The same thing does not happen at all in the other direction.  Do you remember the media mentioning GHW Bush's pardons as justification for Clinton's pardons?  I don't.  I don't think the media is bringing up Clinton because of what they did.  I think they feel like they should be discussing this because they try to be fair to the concerns of Republicans who are constantly screaming about him.  If it wasn’t Clinton it would be something else.  <br /><br />I look at Clinton’s behavior and the treatment of Clinton in the media as two separate issues.  I don’t think one caused another.  <br /><br />I am extremely disappointed in many of the things that Clinton did that allowed the right to justify their treatment of Clinton in the media.  But I think we shouldn’t forget that they were attacking him from the very start and were going to do it no matter what because they were afraid of his political success.  <br /><br /> <blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>Looking forward as well as backward, what bothers me even more about a Clinton Restoration is that I think Sen.

<br />This is why I think that no real conservative is still defending Bush.  The self identified conservatives still on his side are party first country second Republicans, not conservatives.  The Bush administration has been a revolutionary movement and true conservatives have abandoned him a long time ago.  The next president is going to have a lot of precedent to do whatever he/she wants and ignore the power sharing written into the constitution.  I don’t understand why more Republicans have not realized this and objected to the things that Bush has done <span style="font-style: italic">at the very least </span>because of what it will enable future presidents to get away with.  
<br />
<br />I would really like the candidates to address this issue head on and say what they will do to work with Congress on returning to our constitutional checks and balances.  It’s a shame that I am hoping for a candidate who will run a campaign based on supporting three branches of government.</div>

<br />Thanks a lot, we're here all week, try the roast beef.
<br />
<br />For S&G, I googled for some Hillary dirt and found that not only is she an athiest, but a lesbian athiest who has had an abortion.  Who knew?

<br />
<br />Many hilarious things there.  My favorite being that no one believed that Bill Clinton was fooling around until Lewinsky.  Seriously?  It was pretty common knowledge by the first primary.  I also love how even though he is nearly certain that she is a lesbian, that she might have gotten pregnant and had an abortion is a real possibility.</div>
