			<div class="content">So no one cares about the budget deal compromise? A few people on both sides are unhappy, (Dems don't like it because it allows Trump to keep siphoning defense money for the wall, Reps are unhappy because of spending increases) but I guess everyone else is getting in line. And, yes, it's probably dumb to keep using Redstate as my go to for insight into the RWNJ mindset, but not a word about the budget deal over there, and I'm not seeing much in the few lefty blogs I look at. <br /><br />Anyway, it looks like a win for Pelosi, really, unless you believe that the Dems &quot;win&quot; if there is another government shut down. But what I really think has happened is that Pelosi simply took advantage of Trump's utter incompetence. <br /><br />I suppose it's too much to hope for some RWNJ to start going on about how Trump caved, but that's what it looks like to me. <br />Found one article along those lines: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gop-repeals-entire-legacy-tea-party-one-fell-swoop/">https://www.conservativereview.com/news ... ell-swoop/</a><!-- m --></div>

It would be best if he resigned, even though due process (as in an actual trial) acquitted him. Still, I'd cheer if a twitter mob were able to drive him from office.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Wolfgang622 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Bucky wrote:</cite>what is humorous about that article</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, for one thing, it goes on and on and on about how Tweeden’s memory is faulty and how after all she participated in bawdy sketches, the implication of which seems to be, “so it’s perfectly understandable that Franken would pretend to grab her boobs while she is asleep.”  This is deeply ironic considering much of the point of #MeToo is to combat exactly those sorts of retrograde notions, that somehow if a woman, for example, consents to participate in an off-color sketch then of course she consents to be part of an off-color photograph while she sleeps.  Or maybe, if we don’t want to go as far as that, that the former should somehow mitigate how we approach the latter.  Kind of like a much less consequential version of the idea that some people have that a prostitute can’t be raped, or that her rape shouldn’t “count” in the same way.<br /><br />It also significantly downplays what #MeToo broad to the forefront recently, the notion of “rape culture.”  Frankly, the sketches that are supposed to exonerate Franken are really themselves Exhibit A of what is meant by “rape culture.”  The idea that an entire sketch can be made about a man consistently making unwanted sexual advances toward a woman, and it is presented not as problematic behavior but instead something to be laughed at and about - particularly when said sketch is performed in what amounts to a professional setting (USO Shows are not unlike the equivalent of hiring a comedian to do a corporate convention) - is “rape culture” in a nut shell.  The man isn’t punished or shunned for his behavior, the incident is presented as trivial and worthy of mocking laughter, all of which degrades women who experience this very unfunny behavior in real life.  Presenting this type of behavior for laughs also gives license to men who know about such behavior and are in a position to do something to stop it to instead try to convince the person to whom the behavior is directed that it’s no big deal, that they should just deal with it, etc.<br /><br />The photograph was in poor taste and a Franken is where he belongs: out of work as a Senator.</div></blockquote><br />It's not often we disagree, but I disagree. Someone can exercise poor judgment in a comedic setting, where they are employed as a comic, and still be employable in the future. People can do far worse (commit crimes beyond making someone feel uncomfortable), serve time, and deserve a chance for future employment. People change. To this day, I still remember 2 specific instances of off-color jokes I made 20 years ago that I regret. Those jokes are not an indictment of my current character, and I learned from them. <br /><br />Forcing Franken to resign enabled Democrats to maintain the moral high ground. Let's see how good that makes you/them feel when Trump fucking Trump is reelected to the office of President and shits all over everything for another 4 years.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wolfgang622 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Bucky wrote:</cite>what is humorous about that article</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, for one thing, it goes on and on and on about how Tweeden’s memory is faulty and how after all she participated in bawdy sketches, the implication of which seems to be, “so it’s perfectly understandable that Franken would pretend to grab her boobs while she is asleep.”  This is deeply ironic considering much of the point of #MeToo is to combat exactly those sorts of retrograde notions, that somehow if a woman, for example, consents to participate in an off-color sketch then of course she consents to be part of an off-color photograph while she sleeps.  Or maybe, if we don’t want to go as far as that, that the former should somehow mitigate how we approach the latter.  Kind of like a much less consequential version of the idea that some people have that a prostitute can’t be raped, or that her rape shouldn’t “count” in the same way.<br /><br />It also significantly downplays what #MeToo broad to the forefront recently, the notion of “rape culture.”  Frankly, the sketches that are supposed to exonerate Franken are really themselves Exhibit A of what is meant by “rape culture.”  The idea that an entire sketch can be made about a man consistently making unwanted sexual advances toward a woman, and it is presented not as problematic behavior but instead something to be laughed at and about - particularly when said sketch is performed in what amounts to a professional setting (USO Shows are not unlike the equivalent of hiring a comedian to do a corporate convention) - is “rape culture” in a nut shell.  The man isn’t punished or shunned for his behavior, the incident is presented as trivial and worthy of mocking laughter, all of which degrades women who experience this very unfunny behavior in real life.  Presenting this type of behavior for laughs also gives license to men who know about such behavior and are in a position to do something to stop it to instead try to convince the person to whom the behavior is directed that it’s no big deal, that they should just deal with it, etc.<br /><br />The photograph was in poor taste and a Franken is where he belongs: out of work as a Senator.</div></blockquote><br />It's not often we disagree, but I disagree. Someone can exercise poor judgment in a comedic setting, where they are employed as a comic, and still be employable in the future. People can do far worse (commit crimes beyond making someone feel uncomfortable), serve time, and deserve a chance for future employment. People change. To this day, I still remember 2 specific instances of off-color jokes I made 20 years ago that I regret. Those jokes are not an indictment of my current character, and I learned from them. <br /><br />Forcing Franken to resign enabled Democrats to maintain the moral high ground. Let's see how good that makes you/them feel when Trump fucking Trump is reelected to the office of President and shits all over everything for another 4 years.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, if you read my other posts on this subject, which I assume by now you have done or are doing, unless you are like tl;dr which is fair, it should be clear that I don’t really mean he should never work again, far from it.  He can go back to be a comedian or find any other gainful employment.  I absolutely believe that people deserve second chances and all of that.  <br /><br />But being a Senator is a different beast.  You need to be a cut above for that, and again, he resigned, he wasn’t fired.</div>
