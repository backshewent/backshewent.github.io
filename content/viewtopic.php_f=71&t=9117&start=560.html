I guess the difference is that most left wing nuts are pacifists and/or don't own guns?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I disagree, but it's irrelevant anyway. The poisoned discourse is the problem, not the fact that Obama or Bush is the target. <br /><br />I do think there is a difference--the anti-Bush crowd was never cheered on by broadcasters or elected officials. Find a Kucinich quote that is in any way comparable to what some Republicans in the House and Senate are saying about Obama, such as the one cited above.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Did I just imagine Rachel Maddow/Keith Olbermann/Jon Stewart and others routinely criticizing/berating Bush? Oh, they were only saying what was true? I guess that's the difference.<br /><br />More importantly though, I just don't think you can trace a crazy person who assassinates a politician to what is on the radio every day. A crazy person will find a reason to justify what they're doing, and we certainly didn't blame Jodie Foster for the Reagen thing did we?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />What you don't seem to get is that none of us are calling for an end to criticism of the President. Moreover, as I said in the passage you quoted (but appear not to have read so I'll bold it this time is this:  <span style="font-weight: bold">The poisoned discourse is the problem, not the fact that Obama or Bush is the target.</span> 
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm not really worried about a lone crazy person. I'm worried about the breakdown in civil order. It takes very little for that to occur. </div>

<br />And I'm telling you that the disrespect that Bush got, however much I agreed with it, is different in slight degree, not a difference in kind.

<br />
<br />Fair enough. I don't think it's the same thing, because &quot;the left&quot; didn't imply the threat of violence, at least not as a regular, everyday thing. But I'm sure that my biases--like yours--inform how I see it. 
<br />
<br />Maybe the point we can agree upon is the one Paul made, which is also what Friedman gets at: it's difficult, bordering on impossible, to do the country's business when roughly half the country views the president as essentially illegitimate. And sadly, that seems to be a permanent fixture of our political culture. 
<br />
<br />(That said--and I know this is my bias to some extent--I can't view Bush and Obama as equivalent here. Obama, as I see it, has bent over backwards in efforts to engage the Republicans in Congress... and they've shit in his face. Bush, in a way to his credit, was pretty up-front in considering himself only the president of those who voted for him; Democrats were free to uncritically agree with him, and otherwise could pretty much fuck off.)</div>

And sadly, that seems to be a permanent fixture of our political culture. <br /><br />(That said--and I know this is my bias to some extent--I can't view Bush and Obama as equivalent here. Obama, as I see it, has bent over backwards in efforts to engage the Republicans in Congress... and they've $#@! in his face.

<br />
<br />Bush started out engaging Democrats. The first year there were a lot of Dems who voted for his tax cut. NCLB was very bipartisan. The deterioration happened as the years went on. The second term he really didn't cater to the Dems, but they weren't working with him either. He went out of his way to work with Democrats at the start. Obama will probably come to the conclusion that there's no reason to work with Republicans soon too.</div>

<br />
<br />He kind of had to, in 2001: you had a 50-50 Senate, and he was a minority president. And those actions, particularly NCLB, were not totally incompatible with the priorities of Democratic electeds. (You also had Kennedy making it kosher for Democrats to engage; it's impossible for me to imagine a comparably senior Republican trying to create the same kind of governing relationship with Obama today.) 
<br />
<br />What changed was Rove in January 2002, basically saying that they would demagogue the 2002 and 2004 elections by painting Democrats as &quot;soft on terror.&quot; Once Democrats saw what they did to Max Cleland, they understandably got a little upset. 
<br />
<br />But even after that, Bush had far more support from Democrats on the Iraq War--to their severe discredit--than Obama has had from Republicans on anything. (To be fair, if/when he starts a dumb war, I would guess he'll get support from those Republicans who are for any use of deadly force.) Maybe more to the point, this was also true of Medicare Part D and the later tax cuts. 
<br />
<br />Do you really think that the Democrats were as uniformly resistant to Bush as the Republicans are to Obama?</div>

<br />
<br />Since you often complain that you're humor impaired, jh, I will kindly point out that this is something that can be spotted from even this far off as what is known as &quot;a joke&quot;. See, he's contrasting the options of attempting to fund long-term care for the very ill with the alternative, here posited as simply hoping that not much long-term care will be needed. In order to emphasize this point and to make certain no one takes his simplified characterization seriously, he has used the hyperbolic expression &quot;die quickly&quot;. Hyperbole is a device often used (both effectively and ineffectively) in humor. It's presence gives a good clue to whether a speaker is attempting to be humorous or not, particularly in written speech where the speaker or writer's affect is sometimes hard to discern.
<br />
<br />Allan Grayson (who I have no idea whether he is a pinhead or pin oak)is here arguing that under Republican health-care proposals funding for patients with long-term illnesses might not be readily available. If you want to see this as the moral equivalent to calling for the assassination or military overthrow of the President, by all means go ahead.
<br />
<br />Be sure to throw in a parenthetical (nudge, nudge) if you're not being serious and might want your true intentions to be understood.</div>

<br />Facetiousness aside...

<br />I find it curious how some folks on the right, whilst lamenting on poor Dubya's &quot;mistreatment&quot;, so quickly forget (or dismiss) the right wanted to get Clinton out of office basically from the day of his inauguration.  Was there ever a day in his presidency where they weren't digging around, investigating, etc. for something they could use to &quot;get him&quot;?  Probably a big difference now is race.  Back then, the &quot;machine&quot; did all the work.  Now, they have to parse themselves as to not appear racist*, so they let the kooks do much of the work for them.

			<div class="content">As far as the fragility of civil order--no, I don't think we'll have a revolution within the next 12 months. But there are degrees of social breakdown. I don't look at this in ideological terms, mind you. That is, is see typical MTV programming of a piece with with the rantings and raving of Glenn Beck. The Gramsciization of the right is yet another step in the direction of significant social/political/economic disruption. 
<br />
<br />We live in a period of unprecedented dynamic change. Many changes are potentially positive, but for that to happen, we need a system that is willing to openly, honestly, and courageously confront the real challenges we face. Our current political discourse appears to me incapable of addressing those issues. The elite appears to have abdicated is responsibility. 
<br />
<br />Now, is any of this unprecedented? It's hard to say. I believe that western civilization is still coming to grips with the absolute destructive idiocy of WWI and its aftermath. And I turn to Yeats. 
<br />
<br /> THE SECOND COMING
<br />
<br />    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
<br />    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
<br />    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
<br />    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
<br />    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
<br />    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
<br />    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
<br />    Are full of passionate intensity.
<br />
<br />    Surely some revelation is at hand;
<br />    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
<br />    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
<br />    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
<br />    Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
<br />    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
<br />    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
<br />    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
<br />    Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
<br />    The darkness drops again but now I know
<br />    That twenty centuries of stony sleep
<br />    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
<br />    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
<br />    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</div>

But he was growing worried over the accumulating reports of contractor fraud in Iraq, and of the U.S. govenrment’s failure to prosecute them.   <br /><br />Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, he poured hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money into personally representing whistleblowers and filing lawsuits against fraudulent contractors. In March 2006, he got a jury to order contractor Custer Battles LLC to return $10 million in ill-gotten funds to the government. The ruling marked the first time an American firm was held responsible for financial improprieties in Iraq.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />It's a mystery to me why so few Republicans, other than McCain, are at all engaged on the issue of defense contractor fraud and war profiteering. Donations I guess... but that's a really depressing thought. 
<br />
<br />Of course, Grayson was also the guy who figured out that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/22/whoops-anti-acorn-bill-ro_n_294949.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">the anti-ACORN legislation could be wielded against crooked contractors</a>, who've taken exponentially more of our money than ACORN did.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jeff2sf wrote:</cite>Afghanistan - why should we NOT be listening to our military commanders and providing more troops a la Vietnam?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I changed a word. 
<br />
<br />Actually, the Vietnam comparison probably distorts as much as it reveals. The Taliban is widely loathed where the Cong/NVA had popular legitimacy. But the similarities--incredibly difficult terrain, deeply corrupt governing partner, and a guns-or-butter choice that gets harder every year--are worth considering. As is the tendency of the military to always ask for more. Not that there's anything wrong with their doing so--it wouldn't help to have a military that doesn't believe in victory--but there's a good reason for our tradition of civilian control. They've been wrong a lot. 
<br />
<br />I go back and forth on Afghanistan myself. Obviously we can't let the Taliban reconstitute as the governing entity, or al Qaeda reestablish themselves there. But to &quot;win&quot; would require a commitment that Obama (or anyone else) can't sell to the public right now, and maybe shouldn't.</div>

<br />
<br />Rep. Grayson on &quot;the Situation Room&quot; 
<br />
<br />What mostly struck me here was how banal and debased CNN's coverage is. Check out toward the end when they suggest that Grayson, coming from a competitive district, shouldn't have said what he said because of the political consequences. This is really how they think! Forget public service: the point is eternal re-election. 
<br />
<br />As for Grayson himself, I agree with the substance of his remarks--and I'll admit it's gratifying (whether or not it's ultimately constructive) to see a liberal who's willing to fight hard. But I think his tactics here were kind of dumb: by not giving any ground on the smartass &quot;die quickly&quot; remark, he fails to point out that it's satire--a vastly dumbed-down, short attention span update of Swift's &quot;Modest Proposal.&quot; That could lead to the real point: Republicans aren't coming up with solutions, or even semi-plausible proposals, because they're not interested in governing. Right now they're a temper tantrum in the garb of a political party; that he's being criticized for sinking to their level is nothing more than a double standard. 
<br />
<br />I also wish he'd pushed the criticism of other Democrats much, much harder. Max Baucus isn't timid; he's a whore who's taken millions from the insurance companies that, coincidentally enough, will realize enormous new profits under his proposal. Jon Stewart (who's absolutely at his best now when he's going after Democrats; it's pretty much the only time he's funny anymore) <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2009/10/01/jon_stewart_on_the_public_option.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">is there already</a>; jump on that train.</div>
