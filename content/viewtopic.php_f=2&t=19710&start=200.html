And now he's pushing for a return to Smooth Hawley and a collapse of global trade. <br /><br />Those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it. How one can consider his economic actions, what he can control, as smart is an opinion that is distressingly common from people who just want to be considered neutral. &quot;You have to give him credit, the economy is doing well.&quot; No, you don't.

It is maybe not an answer I would 100% agree with, but it is an answer. Some level of government debt is fine, but there is a debt to GDP ratio over which problems start to arise, and I think your formulation that it is a simple transference of wealth to the private sector is a bit of an oversimplification; having said that, I know where suspicions arise from, and I think, for example, the IMF, which is heavily implicated in dealing with government debt and government &quot;bankruptcies,&quot; does at times behave badly, in that it privileges creditors over workers, but it is not necessarily EVIL either, and it has certainly had to intervene in situations where the debt-to-GDP ratio gets out of hand - but I suppose &quot;had to&quot; in my previous clause is a loaded term.<br /><br />Regardless of the particulars of monetary policy and government debt and deficits, about which I am no expert (I used to be better when I read <span style="font-style: italic">The Economist</span> more religiously), the point here is that your previous response - &quot;LOL&quot; - is not a reply to a reasonable position, it is just mindless condescension.

			<div class="content">They did this as a part of an n800 national poll, only asking Democrats the ballot. A campaign wouldn't do a national survey most likely, because there isn't a national election. I'd guess they're doing a steady diet of early state polls that are n400. But they're looking at likely turnout maybe 200k in Iowa and 300k in New Hampshire, with very few minorities so you're not weighting a whole lot, which limits the things you can fuck up. <br /><br />I think most of the national polls usually end up in the 300-400 range which is why there is so much volatility. If they didn't cost so much, it'd be silly to do anything less than 800.</div>

You can't have a combo about economic policy when the policy position of Trump is based on emotion versus economic study. If there is a Trump supporter who has studied Keynesian and Austrian economics, I'd love to meet them. It would be fascinating to learn how they got to where they are, and how they handle the cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />Deficits are fine, until they aren't. The moves that Trump has made with respect to trade, budget deficits, and overall faith in the US as a potential lender of last resort have not been good for the long-term strength of the US. And it will weaken our ability to respond more to the next recession. Ironically, it's only because there aren't many Brantts in the US that hold his view on deficits that enables his comments to stay true in the near term. Until the foxes are clearly running hen house, that is.<br /><br />Monetary and fiscal policy are more related than Trump and team would care to admit. Pushing for loose fiscal and monetary policy in an economic expansion is something that no economist of any stripe would support. It's a political opinion, pushed for by folks with political short-term goals.</div>

I literally LOL'ed when I read his post because he's lecturing me on something he clearly has no understanding of. He and I obviously have completely different philosophical views on economics and more specifically the national debt and budget deficits. <br /><br />Government deficits are not a bad thing. They are the complete opposite. A deficit increases private sector wealth. Surpluses do the exact opposite. Spending to a deficit level is simply the government putting their assets (t-bills) into the private sector. This action creates more wealth for citizens in a country. There is a less than zero chance the US could ever default on it's debt. <br /><br />Deficits and debt are good things at a government level. That's why nobody from either part gives one iota of a fuck about that national debt. Those who incessantly complain (like the Joe Scarboroughs of the world) are suckers who are trying to pick off low hanging fruit voters who compare the government to their personal finances.</div></blockquote><br />I would be fine to hold up my education, both credited and otherwise, against someone with the opinion that deficits and political commitments to fiscal responsibility do not matter. And that it's a difference of &quot;philosophy.&quot; Perhaps you'd feel less comfortable with your &quot;philosophy&quot; by visiting Argentina, where they are learning hard lessons about fiscal and monetary commitments.</div>

I think he's done a good job stimulating the economy through tax cuts and more specifically deregulation that at least attempts to get back to leveling the playing field in the manufacturing sector. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were solid picks for the Supreme Court. I give him a ton of credit for taking on China head on when the easy thing to do would be just continue on with business as usual and ride the strong economic wave to re-election. We'll see how that turns out, but I'd do the same if I were him and hope the short term pain leads to a much better deal for the US long-term. Like that he's ready to bring our troops home from the endless wars in the middle east. Like that he's engaged Kim Jong-Un directly in an attempt to denuclearize the peninsula. <br /><br />The two main big misses are healthcare and immigration. In both cases though, I would say they are a bigger indictment of the Republican party and their complete lack of solutions rather than Trump himself. Trump gave them a golden opportunity to reform both issues and they were completely clueless.<br /><br />Could do without some of the theatrics, but a lot is warranted given how he is treated by the media.<br /><br />It's actually amazing what he has accomplished and that he is still standing given who he has gone head to head with (basically by himself) in the last 4 years.</div></blockquote><br />Why on Earth would a govt want to increase a yearly budget deficit by cutting taxes in the middle of an economic expansion?? &quot;Good job stimulating&quot; the economy??? It's non logical. He's been pushing for low interest rates from the Fed since he's been in office. It's almost as if he wants us to have a worse recession. And now he's pushing for a return to Smooth Hawley and a collapse of global trade. <br /><br />Those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it. How one can consider his economic actions, what he can control, as smart is an opinion that is distressingly common from people who just want to be considered neutral. &quot;You have to give him credit, the economy is doing well.&quot; No, you don't. He'd be better off going against his instincts on every economic policy.</div></blockquote><br /><br />LOL</div></blockquote><br /><br />Werthless raised some really valid points, and this is your response? <br /><br />Lots of Trumpeters respond in this type of fashion and from this you can maybe understand why the reputation of the average Trump-acolyte isn't super great.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />To me they are not valid. I literally LOL'ed when I read his post because he's lecturing me on something he clearly has no understanding of. He and I obviously have completely different philosophical views on economics and more specifically the national debt and budget deficits. <br /><br />Government deficits are not a bad thing. They are the complete opposite. A deficit increases private sector wealth. Surpluses do the exact opposite. Spending to a deficit level is simply the government putting their assets (t-bills) into the private sector. This action creates more wealth for citizens in a country. There is a less than zero chance the US could ever default on it's debt. <br /><br />Deficits and debt are good things at a government level. That's why nobody from either part gives one iota of a #$!&@ about that national debt. Those who incessantly complain (like the Joe Scarboroughs of the world) are suckers who are trying to pick off low hanging fruit voters who compare the government to their personal finances.</div></blockquote><br />I would be fine to hold up my education, both credited and otherwise, against someone with the opinion that deficits and political commitments to fiscal responsibility do not matter. And that it's a difference of &quot;philosophy.&quot; Perhaps you'd feel less comfortable with your &quot;philosophy&quot; by visiting Argentina, where they are learning hard lessons about fiscal and monetary commitments.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This time I'll go with &quot;LMAO&quot; in regards to you comparing the US to Argentina. <br /><br />Terrible. Just terrible.</div>
