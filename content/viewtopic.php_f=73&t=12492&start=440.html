I also thought it was very strange that it wasn't mentioned since NJ politics and fiscal stuff often comes up and Christie is a possible future POTUS candidate.</div></blockquote><br />I thought &quot;poor New Jersey&quot; was probably referring to the big toll hikes on the Hudson River crossings which were agreed to on Thursday, but I guess I was wrong and PiP is better at reading minds than I am.<br /><br />Fitch was the third of the three ratings agencies to downgrade New Jersey's debt this year. I didn't think it was very strange that no one noted it in this thread when S&P and Moody's downgraded the debt in February and April. I didn't think it was very strange that no one noted it in the first 24 hours this time either. New Jersey has a lot of debt and unfunded liabilities, more than just about every other state in the country. Christie has done a good bit to rein in some of the future liabilities and the present growth of spending, but hasn't been able to contribute enough to the pension fund in the state budget. The state has done a lot to get its fiscal house in order in the past two years, but it still needs to do more.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />I thought it was the big NJ news of the week and figured my comment would be understood. My bad, I guess.<br /><br />still sucks to be downgraded.  Probably wasn't christie's fault, but neither was it obama's and that hasn't stopped the GOP from acting like it was.

			<div class="content">Clinton's Yugoslavia action was also highly successful, with no US casualties, but panned from beginning to end by the Republicans.  Obama not being severely panned on Iraq and Afghanistan only because these are wars started by a Republican President.  Think of it -- Libya and Yugoslavia efforts bad, Iraq good.  Our military doesn't do well trying to occupy and control what are basically third-world countries.  I guess we start by picking lousy local leaders, but really, no matter how much many of the locals may be happy to have our initial intervention, our big presence on the ground eventually becomes very grating and a giant target for low tech attacks.  President H.W. Bush had the right approach to Iraq.  Go in, shock and awe, shake things up, leave it to the natives to put the china crockery back together.  Had he shot down Saddams helicopters and aircraft after the ceasefire, he would have had it almost perfect.</div>

Clinton and Obama shot down early suggestions by cameron that they support the rebels with airpower because they were concerned how it might be perceived by the Arabs and Syria - they didn't want to spook allies into thinking they might be next on the list.<br />Then about what, two weeks later it looks like ghadaffi might be about to crush what remained of the rebels, and Syria is looking dodgier by the second and suddenly they're backing NATO going in. Ghadaffi started out on the back foot in the campaign and the rebels made early advances that they couldn't consolidate without aircover. They were also getting hit by the Libyan airforce. Not clinton's finest hour.</div>

Clinton and Obama shot down early suggestions by cameron that they support the rebels with airpower because they were concerned how it might be perceived by the Arabs and Syria - they didn't want to spook allies into thinking they might be next on the list.<br />Then about what, two weeks later it looks like ghadaffi might be about to crush what remained of the rebels, and Syria is looking dodgier by the second and suddenly they're backing NATO going in. Ghadaffi started out on the back foot in the campaign and the rebels made early advances that they couldn't consolidate without aircover. They were also getting hit by the Libyan airforce. Not clinton's finest hour.</div></blockquote><br />My impression was the Obama administration was somewhat reluctant because, well, some of the rebels factions weren't really the goodest of guys (some reports of genocidal acts against black libyans and African immigrants early in the conflict).  That it was framed as a &quot;humanitarian effort&quot; kind of hints the Obama administration may have viewed it as a damned if you do damned if you don't scenerio, a potential cluster fuck.  So I can understand why there may have been some reluctance or caution.  While some sort of democracy is a likely outcome, it is also as likely to become a power vacuum with the four rebel factions fighting each other to grab as much of the power pie as each can.  It's also possible it may get ugly and become an all out civil war resulting in a divided Libya (east/west).  There's no guarantee this will have a feel good fairytale ending.</div>

We respect that,&quot; on wednesday 2nd. given the pleas from libyan diplomats and the rebels themselves for a no fly zone, this seemed kind of odd to say. <br /><br />By the 3rd of March, the rebels were being pushed back.  Although they captured Ras Lanuf, they were bombed out of it the next day.  In between the 7th and 9th of march Qadaffi had grabbed Ras Lanuf, as well as bombing and taking Zawiya.  <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-08/world/middle.east.africa.unrest_1_libyan-leader-moammar-gadhafi-ras-lanuf-opposition-group?_s=PM:WORLD" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Casualties at this point were reckoned to be anywhere between 1000 and 2000</a>.

It wasn't a case of the US trying to avoid being seen as leading the charge.  Although the operation did prevent the fall of benghazi, it did not prevent casualties and heavy bombing elsewhere.  They reckon they'll never know how many were killed in zawiya.  It's possible that prompter action would have prevented some of the worst battles and bombings.  And the delay wasn't an operational one as the UK, the US and the French either had forces in the area or were able to get aircraft there quickly by flying from bases in Italy. The US did not back the un resolution at considerable political peril, [ur=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12723554l]since broad approval was already there from the arab league[/url].<br /><br />Given the contex of a glacial response of the US to concretely support the revolution in Egypt, a foreign policy in the region which followed the principle of better the dictator you know (as evidenced by US funding for military spending for the likes of Mubarrek in egypt, or an <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/86465/syria-assad-bush-obama-pentagon" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">unwillingness to actively oppose the likes of assad in syria</a>), it seems to me the most likely explanation for nearly a month of inaction was waiting and watching how the situation developed.  They wanted to avoid any of their allies (arabs) or preferred enemies (syria) thinking that if they too brutally put down their own mass protests, that us-backed military action might follow.<br /><br />So no, it was not Clinton's finest hour.</div>

That even leaves aside the time it takes to marshall support from other countries, western and Arabic. We're ALREADY involved with two other wars, and we're not allowed to take a month to figure things out? And hey, nothing said Britain and France couldn't get involved unilaterally, it's not like we'd have started a war with them or sanctioned them. I mean cripes on Tuesday, we helped save lots of lives. If we jumped into every conflict after a week of hostilities, we'd be broker AND more despised.</div>

You can ascribe the US hesitancy to go all in early as due to a lack of moral fiber, financial capability, or political support or even a reluctance to commit American lives to yet another ambiguous overseas adventure. But in point of fact the efforts resulted in a relatively quick rebel victory that is not seen as a US supported effort. That has all the attendant benefits of minimizing loss of life (certainly American lives, and the eventual degree of support did allow protection of the rebels), allowing the revolt to viewed as an effort at self-determination, rather than being imposed upon, which should increase general support, and a lack of commitment to a physical US presence now or in the future. Granted, the US played this in a way that it was hoped would be best for US interests. I don't think that has to be apologized for. Nor is any apology necessary for not presuming to know what actions would be in the long-term best interests of the Libyan people. Our track record on this is not great, so I don't mind the US standing on the sidelines for this.<br /><br />I had great fear the Libyan situation could go way wrong, and instead it turned into an ambiguous and limited success. I'm not sure in the current foreign policy climate that that doesn't make it Clinton's finest hour.</div>

I gave examples and reasons based on those examples as to why I think you're wrong. <br /><br />Then I returned to my main point, which is that the slow US response to developments in the Egypt and Libya was more in keeping with standard policy of keeping the region stable by backing dictators or autocrats, at the cost of the people of those countries who wish to express dissenting political opinion. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12792637" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">For example, in February and March, the US was happy to back saudi arabia's use of tanks on protestors in Bahrain.</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>No one in America actually WANTED this war.</div></blockquote> <br />So then you move to a new reason - that the unwillingness to move was out of a wish to reflect the unwillingness of the american populace to go to war.  Fine.  Please justify this with votes in the senate/congress/opinion polls which show a consistent leaning against military action from the point at which it was the un resolution for a no-fly zone was drafted and up to recent weeks. Then put forward a convincing argument that US government is prepared to take its lead on foreign policy from opinion polls and the elected bodies rather than interagency preference and exisiting policy. better yet, show me that there has been a definitive shift in existing policy in the region with regard to leaders who kill and incarcerate their own populace for dissenting politically. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>So the Americans take a month, a month, to figure out their options, push through in the face of a lot of domestic apathy/antipathy to help people with no particular strategic goal in mind, and we get shat on by you for moving too slow?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'll give you the same answer I'm about to give swish.  The rebels took key cities and towns in Libya very quickly within the space of two weeks.  It was perfectly apparent that they had no air support, and so their chances of maintaining their hold on those cities  was small, especially when a significant proportion of their forces (perhaps the vast majority - certainly, that was what was reported) were young and inexperienced.  There was an opportunity to step in quickly, and the operational side of things was already prepped.  All it took was the UK and France knowing that they would get US backing to the security resolution. That was not immediately forthcoming.</div>
