So much for believing women. <br /><br />I suppose we should be happy we got a scalp because Franken had the decency to admit some inappropriate behavior, plus the bonus of being a Jew.

Taken alone, it wouldn’t mean much, but her account of her time with him made it pretty bad.<br /><br />Trump openly bragged about (admitted/confessed to) his sexual assault. “Grab them by the pussy” “I just start kissing them” “moved on her like a bitch” “when you’re a star they let you do it”<br /><br />Any one of those lines should be a political death sentence taken alone, unlike the picture.</div>

We take each person and check it out.  Franken's had about 7 or 8 women complain about his conduct. That gets to be a little ridiculous to disbelieve.

He should resign.  He's also one of the worst persons ever birthed and has no moral code or sense of impropriety or humility.  I'm not bothering with trying to get that fool out of office until 2020.</div>

If true, any one of the things Trump has bragged about is worse than the worst interpretation of the photo.  The problem is, that it is easy to explain Trump's words as braggadocio and his history supports that he is a lying asshole who wants people to think he's something he is not (a player, a genius, presidential).  The GOP failed as a party by not forcing him to step down then, and they're failing now by not holding him (and Moore, and Farenthold, and whomever is next in line) to task.</div>
