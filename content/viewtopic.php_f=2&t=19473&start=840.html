Biden isn't going to get those people--and besides, his political instincts are from an era when campaigns were centralized affairs run and staffed by professionals. That style of campaigning isn't nearly as effective in today's political environment. <br /><br />The Obama comparison is interesting, because in many ways, he campaigned as a progressive, but governed like a moderate. Perhaps that was in part a concession to political reality. It's pretty hard to see stuff like a consumer protection agency as really all that progressive, given that the big banks and Wall Street were left intact, and zero people were even charged for crimes in the wake of the financial crisis. <br /><br /><br /><br />There are two big establishment Democratic hopes out there, and in a weird way, they offset each other. The first is looking at how changing demographics should really be generating increasing Democratic majorities--Republicans have big problems with non-whites and people under 30. This of course is well known. But there's also this establishment Democratic belief that they can also peel away big money Wall Street/Tech money away from the Republicans. This is why Obama and others were loath to really make those people pay for the 2008 crisis.<br /><br />It is the case that consultants get paid big bucks when campaigns raise big bucks, so they have a vested interest in keeping the Wall Street/Tech money flowing. <br /><br />And let's be honest--for this Dem donor class, the Trump years have been fine. They've made tons of money, they've been deregulated. So, yeah, they're quite receptive to Biden's &quot;I'm not going to change anything&quot; message. But ultimately, it's a terrible message, a losing message. Biden's record is terrible--he's lost over and over again. (To use a baseball metaphor--he's one of those &quot;toolsy&quot; guys who can't play the game.) Trump's message was the opposite--he practically campaigned on the idea that &quot;I might not make things any better, but at least it will be different&quot;. <br /><br />The media have created a myth of Biden's electability, and I think that's what's feeding the polls right now--there's a big chunk of Democrats who really care about nothing other than figuring out which Democrat is most likely to beat Trump. There really isn't anything wrong with that position. But the media are, in my view, wrong about this. Because they are dumb. And really, at the elite level, they aren't much different than the Wall Street/Tech/Consultant types.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Eh, I don't think &quot;we're going to move this country from capitalism to socialism&quot; is a winning message either. The average American is center-right.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Of course, none of the Democratic candidates, not even Bernie, are really articulating anything close to socialism. That's our stupid media for you. <br /><br />One of the weird things about politics is that in general, the kinds of policies articulated by say Elizabeth Warren are popular with most Americans. At least they're a lot more popular than Republican alternatives, even in red states. I've pointed this out before, but its importance cannot be understated--in a referendum (non-Presidential election year mind you) Arkansas overwhelming voted to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour over three years. Despite this, the Democrats have not translated this into electoral success. <br /><br />Or consider teacher strikes and the support teachers received in Oklahoma and West Virginia. Again, states where Democrats haven't done well. <br /><br />There's a take away here--the incrementalism and moderateness of mainstream Democrats that looks so appealing to urban coastal elites is terrible from an electoral standpoint. <br /><br />I also believe that one reason Obama won states like Indiana is precisely because even though he pretty much governed in that moderate mold (moving very slightly left of Bill Clinton, but probably less than the country had moved in those years) he campaigned as a progressive. His campaign slogan was Hope and Change!</div>

The gerry-mandered re-districting, the wiping of voter rolls, the unbridled money from Koch and others, and the control the mass media by what questions are asked, and how things are summarized, key wording and language.<br /><br />2) 3 forces have come together in the last 40 years since Reagan - the hateful angry white man, who is KKK, or neo-nazi, or guns and keep governemtn off me, they have joined with the religious right who hate gays and abortion and they have all combined with a lot of the conservative traditional Rockefeller republican that want de regulation and no taxes.<br /><br />So many things now taken for granted, like financing as a method to great riches, and exploiting workers, gutting workers. Making it normalized to have 2-3 jobs, massive debt and then poisoining of the population.<br /><br />3) The Dems were strong when for a time they took over the Southern dixie-crats. But those people many - have shifted from relating as workers who hated the ROckefellers to being massaged in to the social issue wars, and hating the integration of America<br /><br />The other Dems, the Clinton,Obama DNC dems, have been pro military, pro Wall street and nothing like even Jimmy Carter let alone JFK let alone FDR.<br /><br />It's an illusion that the Dems have really every been a real liberal party. It's the party that captured a lot of intellectual, academics, real labor, teachers unions, etc...<br /><br />The reason Nader and Green Party and Bernie - have gotten some limited traction, is because they resonate for that faction of the Democratic Party.<br /><br />And the reason Joe Biden is being served up right now, is that the DNC Clinton Obama wing of Dems, don't want a Bernie or Warren, they'd rather have Trump. If Biden gets in great, but if it's Trump or Bernie, they'd rather have Trump because while it's irritating and he'd such am embarassment on so many levels, their personal interestes align with his policies.<br /><br />As well, it's unlikley in my lifetime that the SCOTUS will ever be 5-4 more liberal than extreme right. Even with a Biden in there. <br /><br />If we had no electoral college, nationalized voting that was managed at the Federal level - not by states, and proportional representation, we'd have no majority party we'd have roughly 3 factions that would mirror roughly Rep Dem DNC and Bernie Dem. And the conversation in D.C. be different if not allthe policies.<br /><br />I'm not hopeful for 2020. I think 45 will prevail again for similar reasons as the first time, and especially if Uncle Joe ends up getting the Dem bid. He will get less support than Hillary did I think or similar - if he loses the women that were really staunch Hillary, but gains some people who are conservative but abhor 45, then that's a push. But in the big scheme, where the real analysis is done and the billionaire class puts money to secure certain outcomes, 45 will get the electoral college again - and so much corruption at state levels. Miss isn't going blue. Nor is Montana. <br /><br />The young people I'm connected to, and I live in a small town that is particularly hippie groovy vibe - and while many of them are not well read nor have a deep sense of history, they are in tune to nature, toxic culture, toxic food, toxic environment - and they want to see fundamental change to make a healthier chance for humanity. They are NOT thinking in terms of the political playing field, they dream of paradigm shifts and an entire change in the way of being. It's not going to happen. Not now. With all due respect to AOC and some other young turks, they don't have enough ammo to really change the entire way the world works.<br /><br />So this thing is going to run it course with or without 45. With or without a civil war or more repression or more changing of civil rights. My age demographic is a dinosaur now. The America I grew up in, doesn't exist anymore and things I took for granted are well eroded. I was born only 25 years after FDR's policies post-depression. But in another 10-15 years that will be 100 years back. <br /><br />What surprises me over and over, is that people don't unify around class. Class interests. They unify around social issues. Race. Ethnicity. And other cultural markers. It's frustrating to live in 2019 and see how religious so many of your fellow citizens are...<br /><br />I would take almost any Dem over 45. Even Uncle Joe , but Warren and Bernie are splitting the same support group. Harris has issues but she's playing the intelligent young woman of color card - and when this field goes from 20- to 10 to 5 to 3 - not sure yet how this plays out. I know Biden has too many holes he's too stuck in the past - and can't relate to young people. He's the connsummate long time politician - they found his quotes in a Delaware newspaper from 1975 where he adamantly railed against busing kids for integration. But that only popped up on alternative news channels. I doubt Fox or MSNBC will speak to it. MSNBC doesn't talk about Yemen at all. It took Bernie speaking about that to get any word on the topic.<br /><br />So we have to remember where most people get their information and what is the normalized forum for people to even have discussion.  I don't follow any mainstream news channels, I get 90% of my information from alternative sources all of which are leftward.<br /><br />Im not encouraged of hopeful.</div>

In Obama's last two years with a GOP Congress he entered into the Iran Deal and Paris accords (not that those were great things IMO, but they happened). He also didn't trot around the world fellating Kim Jong Un and trashing our allies in NATO and whatnot. In Trump's first three years he's torn up various agreements, slapped tariffs on everything that moves, done a lot of not great and inhumane things on the immigration front, and seems to be teetering on the brink of declaring war via tweet all without the backing of Congress.<br /><br />In order to enact lasting policy change you need both houses of Congress and the White House. But if you're only gonna have one of the two, you can achieve (or destroy) a lot more with the White House than with Congress.</div>

If I could choose between replacing Trump with Biden or flipping the senate, I’m taking the senate 100 times out of 100.</div></blockquote><br />This is an insane taek btw</div></blockquote><br /><br />I was just asking if the senate could flip and pointing out that it’s as important as the presidency. Not saying that it’s one or the other.</div></blockquote><br />It's not as important as the presidency. In Obama's last two years with a GOP Congress he entered into the Iran Deal and Paris accords (not that those were great things IMO, but they happened). He also didn't trot around the world fellating Kim Jong Un and trashing our allies in NATO and whatnot. In Trump's first three years he's torn up various agreements, slapped tariffs on everything that moves, done a lot of not great and inhumane things on the immigration front, and seems to be teetering on the brink of declaring war via tweet all without the backing of Congress.<br /><br />In order to enact lasting policy change you need both houses of Congress and the White House. But if you're only gonna have one of the two, you can achieve (or destroy) a lot more with the White House than with Congress.</div></blockquote><br /><br />When you have an incompetent criminal in office, having a senate and house that don’t bow down to him would make a world of difference. Trump would likely be impeached and removed from office if there were a democratic majority in the legislative branch. Hell, we’d probably be looking at President Pelosi before this term is up.<br /><br />I was mainly referring to the awful shit that’s being enabled because Mitch McConnell is a shitstain who doesn’t care about duty.<br /><br />And yea, I don’t like Biden and have zero faith in him doing anything productive in the interest of the public while he has a Republican senate. So at least I’d have the catharsis of watching Trump go down miserably.</div>
