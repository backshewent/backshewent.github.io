But the question is then, what you do about it. Saying &quot;tough tuchus&quot; to the kids who happen to be born to the wrong parents isn't enough, certainly not for the kids, and also not for society that has bear the burden as well. As monkeyboy mentioned, the question then comes to be what you do via policy and law to attempt to establish or recreate this environment for the unfortunate many. It's not easy to work this out, and it always fall somewhere short, but Lord knows it's worth the effort and that personal responsibility canards don't get you anywhere.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite>These are the graphs that most troubling... it's poor, uneducated women and men who are having kids out of wedlock, when a stable marriage is a positive predictor of your future success. The parenting gap explains 40%(!) of the cognitive gap between children at age 4. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/can-smart-economics-turn-us-into-better-parents/279695/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Link to Atlantic article</a><br /><br />Education policy, which is one avenue through which the cycle of poverty can be broken, is only 1 piece of the puzzle. It's up to parents to provide an example for their kids, and instill the values that are necessary for success (hard work, determination, commitment, etc). <br /><br /><img src="http://www.heritage.org/~/media/Images/Reports/2012/09/sr117/chart5.ashx?w=600&h=673&as=1" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_orkXxp0bhEA/SWoSYqmjONI/AAAAAAAAPBw/hwKOdVlyBsI/s1600/090110-10pct-single-parent-17pct-violent.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://whyfiles.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/single_parent.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2014/01/22/140122_XX_fig1.jpg.CROP.promovar-mediumlarge.jpg" alt="Image" /></div></blockquote><br /><br />It's funny because we talk about these issues a good bit in my environmental science class because they affect the environment so much. To get down birth rate, which would certainly help these issues, you use contraception, reduce poverty, reduce child mortality, and provide education and equal rights to women. It hasn't been the magic bullet in Africa due to a host of other factors (colonialism, corruption, war, outside exploitation by huge corporations, etc) , but it's worked pretty much everywhere else. So, more money for family planning, education (especially for women), and a real attack on poverty rather than what's been done so far, would be the way I'd go.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Correlation&lt;&gt;causation<br /><br />Again, it's pretty clear to me that the increase in out of wedlock births has a lot to do with the decline of labor unions and various Republican policies based on the idea that women who have sex out of wedlock ought to be punished, especially if they're poor.</div>

Best case is he'd learn something about the kind of shit people who actually work do. They aren't &quot;pursuing careers&quot; like Will and Ryan, for fuck sake. They're working. <br /><br />What's Will and Ryan doing, besides listening to themselves talking?</div>

With no public warning Friday, agents from the Rhode Island State Police, US attorney’s office, FBI, and the criminal investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service swarmed the speaker’s office, told employees to step outside, and then hauled away boxes of potential evidence. Agents also visited Fox’s home in Providence. The investigators executed two federal search warrants, said Jim Martin, a spokesman for Peter F. Neronha, the US attorney for Rhode Island.<br /><br />Fox announced Saturday he would resign the speakership he has held for four years and will not run again for the House seat he first won in 1992. He has not directly addressed the substance of the investigation.<br />Fox, a groundbreaker as the state’s first openly gay House speaker, oversaw a number of major initiatives as speaker, including pension overhaul, legalization of same-sex marriage rights, adoption of a new education funding formula, and a voter identification law, said political scientist Maureen Moakley of the University of Rhode Island. She is concerned that his abrupt departure in the middle of a legislative session, and the “thrust and parry of who will be the next speaker,” could disrupt the work of the Legislature as it enters its busy spring season.<br /><br />For Rhode Islanders eager for the economically distressed state to outgrow its reputation for ham-handed political scandals and outright corruption, the raid on Fox’s office — and the Democratic lawmaker’s quick surrender of his post — is a disheartening setback.<br /><br />“<span style="font-weight: bold">This General Assembly of ours needs a good enema,”</span> Ted Collins, a retired Providence police officer who owns several rental properties in the city, said in an interview Monday. “But the reality of this situation is, it’s not going to happen.”<br /></div></blockquote></div>

In reality, policy shifts have made it more feasible for a single woman to raise a child -- or not, as her preference may be. Between the tendency of family court to side with the mother in custody battles, the birth control options available both pre and post conception, the monetary support of our federal government for low income parents, the equal pay act of 1963 and subsequent enforcement... I'd love to understand how the system has gotten <span style="font-weight: bold">worse </span>for women in the last 50 years. These are all examples of government increasing the autonomy of women, and for better or worse, it has resulted in an increase in poor and uneducated women choosing to raise kids alone.</div>

More choice so poor kids aren't forced to go to bad schools, longer school days (8-5) so parents have the ability to work a normal day, and expansion of early learning programs funding (pre-K) for the poor. The Atlantic article mentioned that there are programs that actually teach parents how to be better parents, but I imagine that will be derided here.</div>

			<div class="content">i said they are being worked on, such as offering birth control with insurance so women have control of their cycles, their bodies and lives.  paid sick leave, equal pay discrimination laws, and so on.  things that will actually help people's daily lives and put them in a place to be able to get more money and be able to educate their children.  but, birth control appears to be some big issue now after it used to be a settled matter. people don't appear to get that it isn't aborting anything. paid sick leave has somehow been spun into a burden on business owners when they would have less turnover if they had it. equal pay only makes sense.<br /><br />edit: perhaps the biggest issue is the way our judicial system has incarcerated too many men and unjustly targeted some men over others, disrupting their nad their families lives.</div>

			<div class="content">i'm not sure if we are talking around each other or what. when something is implemented, it takes years to see the results.  the ACA is 4 years old...we are only starting to see the effects (ignoring that people are attempting to undo aspects of it). This includes the effects of birth control being routinely available for women.  I'm also unsure how more birth control will result in your guess. People being in control of their lives and being able to delay a life event will make them poorer? <br /><br />Ask women if they are being paid the same as their male counterparts.  They are now allowed to sue for backpay when they find out, but it remains in all aspects of our workforce.<br /><br />In any event, I fail to see how someone having a child outside marriage is something to be frowned upon. that's their choice. all we can do is make sure it is an informed one that is they were ready for.</div>

In reality, policy shifts have made it more feasible for a single woman to raise a child -- or not, as her preference may be. Between the tendency of family court to side with the mother in custody battles, the birth control options available both pre and post conception, the monetary support of our federal government for low income parents, the equal pay act of 1963 and subsequent enforcement... I'd love to understand how the system has gotten <span style="font-weight: bold">worse </span>for women in the last 50 years. These are all examples of government increasing the autonomy of women, and for better or worse, it has resulted in an increase in poor and uneducated women choosing to raise kids alone.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Neither child custody nor equal pay laws do much for poor and uneducated women. Again, I would place much of the cause on all this on high levels of incarceration and the absence of entry level jobs that pay enough to support a family. Those two factors alone have made things much worse for all. I think you overestimate the availability of birth control to low income people--first of course, the effective use of birth control requires education. Second, many forms require access to a physician or other health care professional. Finally, there's a cost involved. And the rhetoric surrounding birth control and the ACA, on top of &quot;legitimate rape&quot; type comments that are common lead to world where there are substantial obstacles to effective birth control.</div>
