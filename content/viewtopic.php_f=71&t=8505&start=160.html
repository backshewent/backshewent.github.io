			<div class="content"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/15/iran-opposition-rally-banned-mousavi" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Khamenei has ordered the guardian council to hold an inquiry into the allegations.</a>
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>But all three contenders to the presidency, reformist and conservative, have raised serious doubts about the result.<br /><br />Mousavi claimed that, on Friday night, he had been informed by the interior ministry that he had won the election convincingly. That claim was first published on a popular website which was subsequently closed down.<br /><br />There were also reports of a leaked interior ministry document which suggested that Ahmadinejad had come third in the vote.<br /><br />Mousavi has also challenged the decision by Iran's supreme leader to endorse the official results. He is reported to have met Khamenei and asked him to reconsider that endorsement.<br /><br />In a letter to the guardian council, a powerful clerical body that oversees ­elections, Mousavi is also reported to have said: &quot;Fraud is evident and review and nullification is requested.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />Two fine pieces of reporting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fisk" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Robert Fisk</a> here:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/ahmadinejad-whips-crowd-to-frenzy-as-opposition-muzzled-1705296.html]The day started badly with another of those dangerous, frighteningly brief statements from Tehran's loquacious police commander, Bahram Radan. &quot;We have identified houses which are bases for the political mobs.&quot; This was the only reference the authorities would make about the outrageous street battles in which Radan's black-clothed cops beat Mousavi's supporters insensible on the streets of Tehran.<br /><br />Then there was the front page of &quot;Etemade Melli&quot; – &quot;National Trust&quot; in English – which belongs to another of Ahmedinejad's enemies, Mehdi Karoubi. After the election results at the top of the front page – Mousavi officially won only 33.75 per cent of the votes and Karoubi 0.85 per cent – there was a caption: &quot;Regarding the election results,&quot; it read, &quot;Mehdi Karoubi and Mirhossein Mousavi made statements which we cannot publish in our newspaper.&quot; Beneath was a vast acre of white space. You could doodle on it. You could construct a crossword on it. You could draw a red light on it. But you couldn't read those statements.[/url]</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-iran-erupts-as-voters-back-the-democrator-1704810.html]An interval here for lunch with a true and faithful friend of the Islamic Republic, a man I have known for many years who has risked his life and been imprisoned for Iran and who has never lied to me. We dined in an all-Iranian-food restaurant, along with his wife. He has often criticised the regime. A man unafraid. But I must repeat what he said. &quot;The election figures are correct, Robert. Whatever you saw in Tehran, in the cities and in thousands of towns outside, they voted overwhelmingly for Ahmadinejad. Tabriz voted 80 per cent for Ahmadinejad. It was he who opened university courses there for the Azeri people to learn and win degrees in Azeri. In Mashad, the second city of Iran, there was a huge majority for Ahmadinejad after the imam of the great mosque attacked Rafsanjani of the Expediency Council who had started to ally himself with Mousavi. They knew what that meant: they had to vote for Ahmadinejad.&quot;<br /><br />My guest and I drank dookh, the cool Iranian drinking yoghurt so popular here. The streets of Tehran were a thousand miles away. &quot;You know why so many poorer women voted for Ahmadinejad? There are three million of them who make carpets in their homes. They had no insurance. When Ahmadinejad realised this, he immediately brought in a law to give them full insurance. Ahmadinejad's supporters were very shrewd.[/url]</div></blockquote><br /><br />Nice anonymous post by a female Mousavi supporter:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/a-face-in-the-crowd-a-cry-from-the-heart-1705287.html]When I have wiped my tears away, I have something to be happy and proud of. Mousavi may have lost this fraudulent election, but people will not forget him, and what is more they will draw a line between him and what he represents and this government.<br /><br />What is more, we will never forget this event. People will not give up. They are being crushed into silence, but they won't be silent forever. They have new ways to connect to one another. They, the regime, can block Facebook today but they can't do it forever. Something has changed in this country, people have been cheated but they have seized more freedom. Now we are like caged lions, so taking anything from us will be harder in future.<br /><br />I will never lose my hope and as long as I live in Iran, I will do my best for it. America must try to negotiate with Iran. President Obama has offered Iran a chance. This election is a setback, but he must not give up. It is just a moment in time, the blink of an eye. Time will expose the liars' lies and history will be its witness.[/url]</div></blockquote><br /><br />finally a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/14/iran-elections-ahmadinejad-mousavi-tehran" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">comment piece</a> which which gets at the nub of the matter.  Even if the election was a fair one, the mousavi supporters are too significant a block of people for Khamani to ignore indefinitely.  <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>what matters to many Iranians has been the reshaping of Iran's political space to open it up to concepts like pluralism, human rights and the promotion of democracy.<br /><br />Having allowed the space for vigorous debate, the president and the supreme leader who permitted such political expression will struggle to put it back in its box. Despite the mandate he is now claiming, Ahmadinejad's slick populism and Shia messianic imagery may not be enough to paper over Iran's widening cracks now that people have found their own voices.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />the fact that one of the four candidates who complained to the guardian council is himself ex-revolutionary guard, and a conservative to boot, is telling. that large groups of the populace are openly questioning their spiritual leader, khamani, makes me think that diplomacy is the continued best option.  Khamani was effectively giving everyone the finger by initially endorsing the result, and I think in that case, the challenge would have been not to let iran go the way of N. Korea into a 'everyone hates us, we don't care' standoff.  harder to bring pressure to bear in that situation.  
<br />
<br />Regardless, the suggestion of dajafi's that some kind of covert ops be used to keep the rabble-rousers rabble rousing strikes me as a foolish one.  it wouldn't guarantee helping mousavi's people, and would allow ahmadenijad to blame it all on the crafty corrupt west.  that kind of thing strikes me as a desperate, last resort tactic, the kind that usually leaves a lot of burnt military vehicles in the middle of a desert and a crowing ayatollah.</div>

			<div class="content">On Iran, I think the real news would have been if Mousavi had won [or been allowed to win].  Not for a second did I expect to read Mousavi had pulled an upset.  Maybe Mousavi actually did lose the election but I have very, very serious doubt that the vote was 62/38 or whatever the official tally was.
<br />
<br />On party switching, WTF?  I assume things are much more intense in higher level politics in terms of adherence to the party platform and retribution if you don't but in the grand scheme of things should it really matter that you call yourself a Democrat or a Republican?  
<br />
<br />I am probably very naive about such things but, as somebody mildly involved in local politics and strongly considering a run for elected office in 2010, I have a certain lack of respect for somebody who would vote a particular way just because that is his/her party's position on a particular issue.  Elected officials should vote his/her own conscious, IMHO, not the way they are expected to vote by his/her party's leaders.</div>

<br />
<br />Getting votes is difficult b/c most people, most days/weeks/years, don't really care all that much
<br />
<br />so, getting &quot;automatic&quot; votes is helpful. It allows you to focus more on people that actually intend to actively make up their minds.
<br />
<br />to get them, you might have to concede that yes, that outfit that can help with the &quot;automatic&quot; getting of votes for you (the party), may have a point on an issue or 2 or 3 that you - being like most people, most days/weeks/years  - don't really care all that much about*. Now some of those automatic votes would go your way anyway, so that outfit doesn't deserve the entire credit - but as in advertising, or business, or baseball, or other activities, it can be hard to suss out cause/effect when it comes to what produced results - in this case, in the vote-getting process (JHoya will no doubt strenuously object).
<br />
<br />(*I know that YOU care more than most people most days, but I'm just using &quot;you&quot; to make the point more emphatically).</div>

<br />Quick summary: Author claims that 401k were meant to make us more secure, and they don't.  Author feels duped into investing in things he doesn't know about, and wants the government to provide a secure retirement.

			<div class="content">I might have mentioned this before, probably just after the election, but a former neighbor of mine flies his American flag at half-staff because Obama was elected.  Now, the fact that Obama was elected is a great sign in terms of the pervasiveness of racism in America today vs. say 30 or 40 years ago but it is a social disease that will never be fully cured.</div>

<br />Yeah, pretty much crap, especially from a guy who worked for the financial press.  It's not as if you need a great deal of financial knowledge to participate in a 401(k).  You can be really, really conservative if you like and go with essentially treasuries or you can go the robopilot approach of a basic index fund.  People's 401(k)s enjoyed a prosperous period and then a down period.  Not that amazing.  If you planned your retirement life based on the peak and a projection of straight line growth from there, then you were a fool.  If you had a nice nest egg and could afford to retire, then you had the choice of switching into ultra-safe investments like Treasuries.  Reminds me of the boo-hoo couple I saw on TV recently who were bemoaning that they couldn't retire.  They put ALL their $ in GM bonds and felt in ultra-safe, even though the yield was magically way above that of most other bonds.  This sort of wishful thinking puts one about half a step above those who expect to pay for their retirement by hitting the lottery, while spending enough on lottery tickets to actually fund a retirement.</div>

Now some of those automatic votes would go your way anyway, so that outfit doesn't deserve the entire credit - but as in advertising, or business, or baseball, or other activities, it can be hard to suss out cause/effect when it comes to what produced results - in this case, in the vote-getting process (JHoya will no doubt strenuously object).<br /><br />(*I know that YOU care more than most people most days, but I'm just using &quot;you&quot; to make the point more emphatically).</div></blockquote>
<br />Elected reps in Congress and the State House vote as the caucus tells them, because otherwise they lose access to a lot of campaign funds and find themselves with a well-financed primary opponent.</div>
