There was a line item on your insurance where you'd contribute to insuring &quot;assigned risk&quot; drivers. Assigned risk drivers were so bad that they could not get insured unless insurance company got a subsidy from good drivers. A friend of my father used to claim that portion of his insurance as a charitable contribution on his income tax. <br /><br />Remember, if you buy insurance, you're a socialist.</div>

Maybe we can make the car insurance market more fair by not allowing the insurance companies to price by risk. Have safe drivers pay for the damages of the unsafe drivers through higher premiums.

I didn't. Curious about a couple of things: <br /><br />did you watch any of the prior hearings on the topic? If so did you learn anything new today that you had not learned/heard previously?<br /><br />I understand that considerable attention was given to complaints by state department officials that in their view actions that might have saved one or more of the individuals killed were not taken, and that no one has explained why to their satisfaction. Did Issa call anyone to testify who was in a position to address those assertions?</div>

			<div class="content">no not today and that's kind of what's bugging me. that the state dept treats this as a case closed situation based on the december report and brushes these new hearings off as partisan politicking when it's clear that LOTS more has come out since that report, especially the really wrenching testimony today of the #2 us rep in libya, the self described whistleblower greg hicks, who's portrayal of what happened that night and leading up to it vastly contradicts the so-called official record. like i can live with the partisan politics and the empty campaign promises and all that - but what has been most disappointing to me about obama and the administration is the supposed transparency that just isn't there.</div>

I had heard that other officials had offered to testify - individuals with responsibility for deployment of military/security personnel - but whose offers were declined by Issa. I don't know if it's true, but you can probably gather why, if it IS true, that it's hard to give too much weight to Issa's proceedings.</div>

			<div class="content">the only name i heard mentioned in that context was pickering who co-chaired the ARB's december report and in that case i can understand his exclusion at least from today's first proceeding. his version is on the books. the new version is still being ascertained because issa and others felt that first version was inadequate. were there others that got declined? i'm sure some degree of partisanship went into what went on today but on the whole it seemed more genuinely interested in procuring the truth than any other panel, committee or hearing heretofore conducted on the matter.</div>

			<div class="content"><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/benghazi_hearing_darrell_issa_s_house_committee_s_investigation_of_the_death.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">it's not so cut and dry:</a><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>More interesting than that was the explanation—not denial—from outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. “We quickly responded, as [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] General Dempsey said, in terms of deploying forces to the region,” said Panetta.<br />“We had FAST platoons in the region. We had ships that we had deployed off of Libya. And we were prepared to respond to any contingency and certainly had forces in place to do that. But the basic principle here… is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on; without having some real-time information about what's taking place. And as a result of not having that kind of information, the commander who was on the ground in that area, [Africa Command] General [Carter F.] Ham, General Dempsey, and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation.”<br />That grim assessment has been buried under new Benghazi files and blown whistles. And if you break the Benghazi story into a few components, you can understand why. The outrage over the government’s post-attack talking points might be used to implicate Obama administration bureaucrats or political appointees in a pointless cover-up—and it doesn’t hurt that one of those appointees is named Hillary Clinton.<br />There’s disbelief at the low amount of security in Benghazi and Libya before the attack, and at requests for more aid and security—some from Ambassador Chris Stevens, before he was killed. But that doesn’t change the reality of Sept. 11 and Sept. 12, 2012. The Americans in Libya had to work with the tools on hand. That’s what makes the “stand down” question so ugly, even as it’s been altered. That October story about the CIA telling Tyrone Woods and Glenn Doherty to “stand down” and let terrorists attack the Benghazi compound has petered out, and didn’t appear in today’s hearing. The new “stand down” story, as told by Charles Woods, concerns that delay of a seven-man team that ended up arriving a little later, able to evacuate Americans but unable to join the younger Woods and Doherty at the front.<br />In his early interviews, and in his testimony, Hicks resisted several Republican attempts to get him to agree that a “stand down” order occurred. He never used those two words together. The closest he got today came when Ohio Rep. Mike Turner asked him whether he was telling the truth and DOD was lying.<br />“Turner: Just as early as last Monday, Maj. Robert Firman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the account hasn’t changed. “There was never any kind of stand-down order to anybody.” Now that’s a pretty broad statement, “anybody.” What’s your reaction to the quote by Mr. Firman?<br />I can only again repeat that Lt. Col. Gibson said he was not to proceed to board the airplane.<br />Turner: So your first-hand experience being on the site, standing next to Colonel Gibson, who was on his way on that C-130 transport and being told not to go, contradicts what Mr. Firman is saying on behalf of the Pentagon?<br />Hicks: Yes sir.”<br />But the “stand down” quote is the only bit of this contradicted by the Pentagon. Panetta made his comments in October 2012, when Benghazi was still roiling the election. On May 1, 2013, the Pentagon sent a timeline of its actions to the House Armed Services Committee. And according to that, Panetta had OK’d the movement of FAST platoons and a special operations force before 3 a.m. local time, but no aid arrived before the mortar attack that killed Woods and Doherty. According to Hicks, the team wanted to get to Benghazi as quickly as possible. According to Panetta, if it had, it wouldn’t have helped.<br />That’s why the “stand down” question burns. The people who ask it imagine what might have been had a seven-member team rushed to Benghazi and, maybe, some airpower had flown over the city. Panetta and his successors claim, without being too explicit, that none of this would have helped. The die was cast long before the attack, by the weak security at the consulate, and commanders may have decided to cut their losses rather than risking more casualties. And that isn’t a story anyone prefers to tell.</div></blockquote></div>
