Him and his dirtbag kids will move onto some other grift (tv station?) and heâ€™ll be normalized in a few years by centrists when the next psycho comes along</div></blockquote><br /><br />What about those charges hanging over him in NY? Nothing has been filed because they know they can't touch him when he's POTUS. Those charges are coming and I can't see him risking it. Maybe he'll be unsuccessful, but he will try to do something awful. To think otherwise seems crazy to me given his actions so far. Allowing Flynn off the hook is just the water getting another degree hotter. It's not going to stop there, if for no other reason that this strain of the GOP is hungry for complete power.<br /><br />I agree he is sick of being president. He wants to be king.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The guy is old and his team of lawyers will keep him out of prison until he dies. Also, I am sure faced with the alternative New York will drop all charges if he goes peacefully. Really though, the guy cannot continue serving as POTUS past 1/2021 without being validly re-elected. Also, he is capped at two terms, so those charges will be waiting for him in 2025 even if he wins. It would be better for his attorneys to hammer out a deal now, while he still has leverage, than when he is lame duck.<br /><br />I am sure that you recognize that you are a pessimistic person. Your posts often reflect a fairly cynical/negative outlook on life.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Nah, those are just the things I post. I'm in a pretty consistently good mood at home. It's very rare for me to wake up not in a good mood and I'm not even a morning person. <br /><br />But when it comes to Trump, I do see the worse. It has the advantage of being right most of the time. We'll see what happens, but he always run to the lowest common denominator. I don't know why he would stop now.</div>
