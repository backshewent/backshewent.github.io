That's ridiculous. But the handling of it stinks. Whether it's reportage was mollified to protect the president's &quot;terror-free&quot; image heading into October or for other surreptitious reasons isn't and likely won't be known. But we are confidently backing Syrian rebels to the tune of $250 million dollars when there are known al-Qa'ida affiliations also supporting that group. It doesn't get murkier.</div>

			<div class="content">I think it's brutal. We in the military know that death is always a possibility, but we also know the US goes to extremes to ensure our safety in dangerous situations. We expect that if killed, the country will go to extremes to get the remains home...the POW/MIA office Hawaii is still getting remains from WWII, Korea and Vietnam. <br /><br />It's unconscionable to me to think there was an executive level order to leave these guys to die and there were options on the table to assist them. <br /><br />It would literally be the ultimate betrayal of trust...knowing the President doesn't have your back when you are executing foreign policy in a violent area or through violent means. <br /><br />I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be true. But the longer this goes on, the uglier it seems to be. And this troubles me greatly, for many reasons.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>karn wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>karn wrote:</cite>Fair points, and none of which I disagree with. Where I land on the matter is that if the people in charge cannot and will not take seriously something as morally simple as protecting the lives of its people, or, at the very least, being forthcoming about how or why those lives were lost, how then can we, as citizens largely on equal footing with those who died, feel satisfied to entrust those same people with the responsibilities of doing the right thing on the big domestic issues? How are the whitewashing tactics and the handcart reality of the country not directly correlated?</div></blockquote><br /><br />They are - and have been. This event you've chosen to elevate is hardly singular</div></blockquote><br />I would differ and argue that it is quite singular insofar as it undermines some pretty fundamental practices of governance in such a malicious way that it's hard for me to even conceive. Leaving Americans to die and then lying about doing so is so far away from anything I'd ever want to think about my country that is physically repulses me. It's pretty easy to talk about winning a war on terror when terrorist attacks are reclassified as &quot;events&quot; and dead Americans are swept under the rug. It is a big story and not &quot;just another embassy attack&quot; because I believe the tendrils of this administration are wrapped up in some pretty murky dealings. The gentleman from Iowa is likely insinuating further gun running ala Fast and Furious as being a big part of what happened at Benghazi.<br /><br />For the record, I've voted straight Democrat in all 17 elections I've participated in.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Im not sure what you wanted to happen? Airstrike? All out assault? Seems it wasn't <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/05/bengazi-pentagon/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">possible</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The team had been vaguely referred to in the Pentagon’s official timeline (.PDF) of its mobilization for Benghazi, released in October. But Little and Lapan explained for the first time on the record that the U.S. Special Operations Command’s detachment in U.S Africa Command told the team not to head to Benghazi.<br /><br />The team, in Tripoli already to train Libyan forces, requested to hop on a Libyan C-130 cargo plane to head to Benghazi. But Special Operations Command Africa told them not to go, because “there was nothing this team could do to assist,” Little said, opting to tell the team to stay in Tripoli to assist with consular staff’s evacuation from Benghazi.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">According to Little and Lapan, the C-130 the team wanted to fly to Benghazi on had space for the men, but it didn’t arrive in the city until after the battle ended. “There’s no evidence they could have arrived in Benghazi before the end of the attack,” said Lapan, a spokesman for Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dempsey and other top Pentagon officials have previously testified that they could not get commandos or fighter planes into Benghazi in time to save the lives of Amb. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. There was an unarmed surveillance drone over Benghazi, but Air Force fighters in Italy’s Aviano air base lacked refueling tankers to allow them to get to the scene. Special-operations teams in the U.S. and Croatia were initially told to prepare for Benghazi, for a possible hostage-rescue mission, but they ultimately didn’t get closer than a staging base in Europe before the attacks ended.</span><br /><br />The Pentagon’s timeline about what it did in response to Benghazi hasn’t satisfied key Congressional Republicans. “I find it insufficient, which is why I requested additional information from the Department of Defense,” Rep. Buck McKeon, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement today. McKeon wants the Pentagon to prepare a classified timeline for the committee to supplement the public one the Pentagon has released.<br /><br />The Pentagon’s top legislative official, Elizabeth King, told the committee that the Defense Department never prepared any classified timeline, either internally or for the committee. Little and Lapan indicated they did not have a classified timeline to provide the committee. It’s unlikely that today’s hearing will end the controversy over what the Pentagon should have done — if it could have done anything — about the assault on Benghazi.</div></blockquote></div>

Your giving Benghazi attention does not actually do anything to the magnitude of the alleged activities, which do not rise to the level you apparently imagine they do. Read some history.<br /><br />It's good that you're paying attention though</div></blockquote><br />Can you honestly suggest some comparable events I can study as the precedents for willfully leaving American citizens to die at enemy hands? Like, as you know they're being attacked and killed?<br /><br />Re: pacino's bolded statement, how can one determine the length of an ongoing terrorist attack? You send help. Immediately and always. At the very least, send personnel in there to secure the scene - which according to Wednesday's hearing wasn't done for 2 1/2 WEEKS.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Decisions to double down on stupid, or not, are made by organizations of all kinds, in all times, for reasons noble and ignoble - sometimes both at once. You want to pretend that Benghazi is a singular case  of that kind of decision made by the US government - apparently because of the teensy-tinsey politics-begrimed window you have onto the process. <br /><br />Make no mistake - we agree that purely politically calculated inaction in a case like this would be deplorable. <br /><br />I'm not at all convinced the evidence enables you to draw that black & white conclusion, not least because of the untrustworthiness of the individuals in pursuit of such 'evidence', and the manner in which they're pursuing it. You can sniff Lindsey Graham's nutsack all you like. I'll probably continue to advise you against it.<br /><br />I think it's mostly a <span style="font-style: italic">non sequitur</span> but your closing example of things you just gotta do strikes me as odd. You just <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">gotta</span></span> go and &quot;secure the scene&quot; as if that is some kind of well-quantified cookie-cutter, off the shelf process; why, you just dial up the scene-securing squad & they go & <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span></span> that, right? - in a place where you basically have gang rule, and which 4 of yours were just now killed, and your &quot;intelligence&quot; has just demonstrated to you its internal disagreements if not outright shortages of that about what's going on there, and your State staffers are urging the dispatch of flotillas of battleships, or something. I mean, everybody knows exactly what &quot;lockdown&quot; entails - it's part of the culture.<br /><br />I guess I'm saying I just don't feel we're talking insistent multidepartmental, Cabinet-level commitment to lies about WMDs here.</div>

			<div class="content">the major problem that we saw here is that political concerns regarding the impending election, exacerbated by that underminer Romney, seemed to shape what they 'called' things, such as terrorism, some dumb video, etc.  having a terrorist attack before an election isnt a good thing; it never is. i dont think that's a coverup, per se, it's an issue where political concerns seeped into the State Department, which is wrong. the Dec State Dept review said as much, plus there were systemic errors, and people got fired for not having things in place.<br /><br />i just dont think there's anything more to it.</div>

			<div class="content">It seems like the debate now isn't about the issue karn raises, which I think is a valid one even if it seems unlikely that intervention would have helped, but rather <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/us/politics/benghazi-e-mails-put-white-house-on-the-defensive.html?hp" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">how much and by whom the &quot;talking points&quot; were revised</a> between the attack and the following Sunday when Susan Rice wrecked her career. <br /><br />Admittedly it's not the same thing, but I can tell you as a public sector employee involved with policymaking that it's not unusual for talking points to be revised to a ridiculous degree as everybody weighs in. In an election year, doubly so, and with the most viciously partisan adversaries ever seen in a democracy, I'm guessing even more. Here's some of the riveting byplay in this case: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The C.I.A.’s first draft of the talking points in the Sept. 11 attack was e-mailed to a group of senior officials at several federal agencies shortly before 7 p.m. on Sept. 14, according to several officials.<br /><br />About 45 minutes later, the State Department’s spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, raised concerns with the White House and the intelligence agencies, saying the information could be “abused” by members of Congress “to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?”<br /><br />C.I.A. officials responded with a new draft, but Ms. Nuland replied that the changes did not “resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.” A State Department official said Ms. Nuland was expressing concerns that the C.I.A.’s first versions of talking points, intended to be made available to lawmakers, were more explicit than what she had been allowed to tell reporters. She also believed that the C.I.A., which had more than 20 people in Benghazi on the night of the attack, was trying to absolve itself at the State Department’s expense before any investigation was completed by suggesting that repeated C.I.A. warnings about the security situation in the city were being ignored, this official said.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Ugly, okay, but I don't get what the scandal is. It's pretty rich for the likes of Daryl Issa and Lindsay Graham to be clutching their pearls at the notion of spin.<br /><br />Also, it does seem like the fuck up was on the part of the CIA, which if they had 20 people in town both should have picked up on the imminent threat and somehow mobilized to defend the post. But I just finished &quot;The Looming Tower,&quot; which basically fingers the agency for failing to stop 9/11, so maybe I'm just not thinking highly of the CIA right now.</div>

I read somewhere that there are 5 times more people in public relations than in journalism. I just wonder if there's a market out there for real news gathering. Something like a network of web-based local reporters, vetted as being reliable by an editor--a sort of crowd sourcing bottom up model. I think you have to pay them, and they should be trained and have some qualifications so there would be some reliability and accountability. I'd also want this to be a subscriber based service. I don't think the economics of &quot;free news on the internet&quot; model has worked all that well.<br /><br />Also, I wonder if CNN could do better if they got away from the reporter as celebrity model.</div>

			<div class="content">I haven't read everything about it, but it seems like they made the decision to risk the lives lost because trying to save them was either impossible or dangerous enough that it wasn't worth the small chance of saving them. That sucks, but I can't say it was a bad decision. I don't like that they tried to avoid a controversy by possibly covering up how the decision was made, but the party of the AG scandal, 9/11, and all the other scandals of Obama's predecessor trying to call Obama on it is a bit of a joke. They had no interest in the truth when over 3,000 people died or the nation's judicial system was being used for politics or when we wanted to get to the bottom of why we were in Iraq, etc, etc. <br /><br />As for the administration, I've been disappointed in them for a while. But I don't think this rises to the level of some big scandal, no matter how much republicans would like it to be. They are only fighting this battle to hurt Obama's chances of passing other legislation and to possibly hurt Clinton for '16. They don't care about the truth.</div>
