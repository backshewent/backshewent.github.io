			<div class="content">Obama's 3rd debate performance makes sense even if he thought he was winning.  He lost the first debate by being passive and won the second one by being aggressive.  Being aggressive was the safe way to go.  The last thing he'd want to do is risk repeating what happened with the first debate.</div>

The Romney campaign made plausible assumptions. They turned out to be incorrect, and most of the public polls were closer to being correct. Youth turnout was much higher than they were expecting, and white voters made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate, and that was enough (along with things sliding away in the last week due to Sandy or whatever else).<br /><br />They really thought they were going to win. I told you guys this. I wasn't making it up.</div>

			<div class="content">So I've read some comments from republican pols saying that Obama needs to do this or Obama needs to do that. Do these guys realize they have lost? When you lose at something in life, you don't deserve anything in return, isn't that what they have been selling us over the past 6 months? If a guy loses his job or fails at completing college or drops out of high school, he is a failure and shouldn't be supported by the rest of us, isn't that what they've been saying? Now that they are on the losing end of life's stick, they want to be given something that they didn't earn. Fucking hypocrites.<br /><br />Worse, they can't take any responsibility for the loss. It's because the white vote was suppressed or due to Sandy or Christie, etc. How about looking in the mirror? Isn't that what you've been preaching to the country? So now who are the people not taking personal responsibility for their mistakes and lives and asking for handouts? Now who is the 48% (or whatever Romney got)?<br /><br />I personally think Obama should take his agenda and ram it down their throats and dare them to stop him. I want that to happen because I think Obama's ideas are better for the country than the GOP fantasyland of tax cuts leading to economic growth, but I also want him to do it because they have fucking earned the complete disregard for their needs/desires.</div>

But nothing we've heard so far would indicate that.</div></blockquote><br />It's not fair to say they engaged in magical thinking just because the analysis/projections/assumptions did not hold true. If Romney had won, would it have been Silver and the Obama campaign engaging in magical thinking unbefitting of the presidency?</div>

Why do you think he had Obama at around 70% to win with about a week to go when he had Obama leading in around 10 of 11 swing states? Most of the polling companies had used the same set of projections on voter turnout, and most importantly, they came to these projections knowing the assumptions that the other pollsters were using. Otherwise, yeah, if 15 of 18 pollsters (or whatever proportion it was) had independently made these estimates, then it would hold much more weight. But the mountain of evidence you're alluding to overstates the certainty from the polling.<br /><br />And really, this was a thought experiment. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It doesnt really matter if we know ahead of time who wins.</div>
