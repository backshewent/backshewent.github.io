			<div class="content">A lot has been made about the correlation between economic fundamentals and the re-election of incumbents. The thing you have to ask though is which economic fundamentals really predict elections? Now, this one indicates that the growth in real disposal income in the 12 months prior to the election predicted the popular vote total in 2012 rather well. <br /><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lCK6QCF2gCQ/UJq0H7-oDLI/AAAAAAAAE70/xm3lBq6Xt6s/s1600/econvote+2012.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So, another lesson is that when you talk about variables, you do need to specify. If nothing else, this election has been great for providing teachable moments in undergraduate research methods courses.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>phdave wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>When you're living in a world where only 9% of people called are willing to be polled, and the response rate differs across demographic groups, you're going to have to make assumptions about turnout in building your poll. The Romney campaign made plausible assumptions. They turned out to be incorrect, and most of the public polls were closer to being correct. Youth turnout was much higher than they were expecting, and white voters made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate, and that was enough (along with things sliding away in the last week due to Sandy or whatever else).</div></blockquote><br />Assumptions are not plausible if they are contradicted by a mountain of evidence.  This wasn't a thought experiment. There was a lot of data out there and taken as a whole it clearly pointed to an Obama win. I'm thankful that Romney's reliance on echo chamber assumptions only #$!&@ his campaign and not the country like the last Republican administration.</div></blockquote><br />But over the course of the campaign, a lot of national polls pointed toward the same thing the Romney people were seeing in their polling. A GOP enthusiasm gap, strong support from Independents, much closer partisan makeup of the electorate. The assumptions were very plausible. They just ended up being incorrect.<br /><br />A recent example where the exact opposite was true was the Wisconsin recall. Democrats kept talking about how their internal polls were tied even as Republican and most public polls had Walker with a consistent lead at the edge of the margin of error. Republican polls ended up nailing the electorate, while Democratic polls were off the mark. Then there are times where the internals of one party are right, while the public polls are wrong. A good example being 2010 Nevada Senate race, where most public polls expected Reid to lose, but Democratic polling correctly foresaw the strength Reid had among Latino and union voters, and that was what lead him to reelection.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is a fair point, but strikes me as the rare case where the plural of anecdote really sort of is data.

For them to have been right, the polling error would have had to persist through state after state--as Silver repeatedly pointed out. And even in the two cases you mention, my recollection (maybe self-serving but I don't think so) was that by the end of the campaigns, those two races were likely to go the way they ultimately went. In Walker's case, the money seemed to be decisive; with Reid it was his machine (the same reason I never much worried Obama would lose NV this year, though it didn't tip that Senate race).</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't know jh.  This stuff from the article that prompted this conversation reads like a Nate Silver post almost:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>They made three key miscalculations, in part because this race bucked historical trends:<br /> <br />1. They misread turnout. They expected it to be between 2004 and 2008 levels, with a plus-2 or plus-3 Democratic electorate, instead of plus-7 as it was in 2008. Their assumptions were wrong on both sides: The president's base turned out and Romney's did not. More African-Americans voted in Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida than in 2008. And fewer Republicans did: Romney got just over 2 million fewer votes than John McCain.<br /> <br />2. Independents. State polls showed Romney winning big among independents. Historically, any candidate polling that well among independents wins. But as it turned out, many of those independents were former Republicans who now self-identify as independents. The state polls weren't oversampling Democrats and undersampling Republicans - there just weren't as many Republicans this time because they were calling themselves independents.<br /> <br />3. Undecided voters. The perception is they always break for the challenger, since people know the incumbent and would have decided already if they were backing him. Romney was counting on that trend to continue. Instead, exit polls show Mr. Obama won among people who made up their minds on Election Day and in the few days before the election. So maybe Romney, after running for six years, was in the same position as the incumbent.<br /> </div></blockquote><br /><br />Every one of these points are points that were being made by Nate Silver (and, it is worth noting, several others) well before the election.  The information was there to be read and understood, but instead it was willfully ignored.  And while Dems claimed things were tied in Wisconsin, anyone who was following Nate in the run-up to that knew the truth (like myself), and I always suspected Democratic claims to the contrary were simply to make their pleas for contributions plausible.  Who is going to contribute to a campaign that has a 95% chance of losing (as the Dem candidate in the recall election had)?<br /><br />Granted, Mitt was never quite so bad off in Nate's projection, but nevertheless it was clear to anyone taking in the information in front of him that a Mitt victory would be a significant upset.  I assumed that Mitt's campaign's statements to the contrary were of a piece with Democrats' insistence that the recall election was close - simply trying to keep up enthusiasm for fundraising, down ballot election purposes, etc.  <br /><br />If Mitt and his team were <span style="font-style: italic">genuinely</span> surprised that they lost, that does not speak well for their competence.</div>

It's plausible to believe that with a 9% response rate, the polls had a systematic bias. However, we know that people with higher levels of education and older people are more likely to respond to polls than less educated and younger people. So, really, if anything, that would suggest that the polls were undersampling likely Obama voters. They also believed that partisan identification is largely a static characteristic--that people don't switch parties. But there's lots of evidence that PID doesn't work today like it worked 40 years ago--it's fluid, so you can't simply look at the electorate and assume that everyone who was a Republican identifier in 2004 is a Republican identifier in 2012. The unskewed poll guy based his model on this faulty assumption. You simply can't weight polls on party id. Finally, the turnout issue was an interesting one. And experience intelligent hack knows that real enthusiasm has to be for someone, not just against someone. 2004 was the obvious example of this. There really has never been much enthusiasm for Romney, even if there was enthusiasm for getting rid of Obama. So, big increases in turnout over 2008 was unlikely. Finally, why did Republicans count on lower turnout among young voters and ethnic voters? I suppose you could believe that 2012 was going to be different from 2008. But the reality is that youth participation has been increasing steadily since the 90s. On election night, I said that anecdotally it appeared that young people today are much more enthusiastic about voting than young people were 25 years ago. Social media allows for constant reinforcement. Standing on line to vote isn't so bad if you've got a smart phone and bunch of people are tweeting you, encouraging you to stay in line. <br /><br />I suspect the long lines in Florida, if an intentional ploy to drive down minority and youth participation may have had the opposite effect, driving down old white participation.</div></blockquote><br />But pollsters don't just find the first 800 respondents then show you the results. If that was the case every poll would be too heavily weighted toward old people who don't pay attention to things like caller ID. Most polls make adjustments based on age and race, many fewer also weight for Party ID. When you have an election where one candidate is winning 39% of the white vote and 93% of the black vote, a point or two difference on the makeup of the electorate makes a big difference. To a lesser extent the same is true for age since Obama won 60% of the under 30 vote and 44% of the over 65 vote. Everyone makes assumptions - with the help of voter enthusiasm questions, likely voter screens, other measures - about what the electorate will look like. <br /><br />Enthusiasm seemed to be down among a lot of base Dem voters. And, I mean, it was. Obama is 7-8 million votes behind his 2008 total (though they're still trickling in) despite there being 10 million more people living in America than there were at last election. The thing I think GOP polls got most incorrect was GOP enthusiasm wasn't up like they thought. So the stronger Democratic groups made up a larger share of the electorate because middle aged white people didn't show up to vote for a Mormon or Obama's ads were successful in disqualifying Romney or the GOP didn't do a good enough job making an affirmative case for our candidate or whatever your favored explanation is.</div>
