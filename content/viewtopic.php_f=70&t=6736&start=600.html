<br />Until national polls consistently show the race within 5 points, it's not worth getting too worried about individual results in states. Even if he loses Pennsylvania, they'll make it up by picking up VA, CO, IA, NM (is that enough?) and probably Ohio. Or Florida. Or Indiana.

We'd have to be able to somehow determine where he'd be in the polls if he had selected Romney or whomever.  I don't think anyone here expected him to win, so it's hard to argue that he'd be winning now if he selected someone else anyway.  His only real jumps in the polls surrounded his slection of her as VP, and the convention where she played a big roll in the end.  If the best he can claim occurred in the 2008 election are his two jumps in the polls, it's tough to argue that she didn't play a role in both.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't know how exactly one would quantify it, but I do think she hurt, in at least two and maybe three ways. <br /><br />One, the sense among independents that she isn't qualified is really damaging--both because McCain's no spring chicken and has some health concerns, so the prospect of her taking office isn't at all beyond the realm of the plausible, and because it says something about his judgment. <br /><br />Two, while she fired up the Republican base, she also fired up the Dem base--and this isn't a good year for the Rs to run a base polarization strategy. The Dem base is bigger, evidently deeper-pocketed (if for no other reason than because Obama opted out of public financing), and more highly motivated. And if you believe that antipathy is a more powerful motivator, Palin provided that--which wasn't really there with McCain. <br /><br />The possible third way is opportunity cost. If he'd picked Romney, he would have had a more compelling surrogate on economic issues. If he'd picked Ridge (almost wrote &quot;Lidge&quot;...) or Lieberman, he would have reinforced the bipartisan/post-partisan messaging--which would have helped him make the closing argument that voters shouldn't give the Democrats unified control of the federal government, and probably would have preserved his amen corner in the media, which I think deserted him over Palin more than any other one thing. <br /><br />(Admittedly, Lieberman might have ginned up as much agita on the left as Palin has. But I don't think Romney or Ridge or Pawlenty, all former/current blue-state governors, would have done so.) <br /><br />This all seems like a lot to give up to make James Dobson happy.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I agree with your first two observations but I don't agree with the effect.  Up until that point McCain was running a flaccid campaign that attempted to appeal mostly to independents and it wasn't going well.  Bush and Obama both solidified their base first, then went for the indy's - in my opinion McCain realized too late that he hadn't accomplished the first part.  As for energizing the Dem base, I don't see them energized any more than they were before the Palin pick.
<br />
<br />On your third point I think we're back to trying to prove what can't be proven.  Romney might have been nice if he could have predicted the economic meltdown, but remember that Romney is this handsome well spoken man with millions of dollars... that couldn't win a primary to save his life (for the most part).  Whether it was the Mormon thing or the New England thing or the compromized position on abortion, the base just didn't like the guy.  In terms of selecting a pro-choice running mate like Ridge or as social liberal like Lieberman, you're back to square one - how does it help McCain to chase off his base?  Yeah, it might have reinforced a &quot;bipartisan&quot; commitment but at that point, why vote Republican?  I think that's a position that makes sense to someone who tends to vote Democrat but makes no sense at all to a Republican (imagine my suggesting Obama should have chosen a pro-life VP, it ain't gonna happen).  Pawlenty, IMO, would have received the same &quot;inexperienced idiot&quot; treatment Palin is getting.
<br />
<br />But again, I don't want to fall into speaking against my own warning that there's no way to know what would have happened.</div>

<br />
<br />I have no reason to believe this is (or isn't) true but I think Corbett's role should be explained a little.  Google the guy if you want some info.  He's a radio host in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area who was a very hardcore supporter of Hillary in the primary.  Before Obama even won the nomination he vowed not to support him in November.  He's even claimed to have been barred from an Obama rally in Scranton that he attended as an employee of WILK radio.  So he's not exactly a neutral source here.  His disdain of Obama is pretty well known to those in NEPA who listen to WILK.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>VoxOrion wrote:</cite>I agree with your first two observations but I don't agree with the effect.  Up until that point McCain was running a flaccid campaign that attempted to appeal mostly to independents and it wasn't going well.  Bush and Obama both solidified their base first, then went for the indy's - in my opinion McCain realized too late that he hadn't accomplished the first part.  As for energizing the Dem base, I don't see them energized any more than they were before the Palin pick.<br /><br />On your third point I think we're back to trying to prove what can't be proven.  Romney might have been nice if he could have predicted the economic meltdown, but remember that Romney is this handsome well spoken man with millions of dollars... that couldn't win a primary to save his life (for the most part).  Whether it was the Mormon thing or the New England thing or the compromized position on abortion, <span style="font-weight: bold">the base just didn't like the guy. </span> In terms of selecting a pro-choice running mate like Ridge or as social liberal like Lieberman, you're back to square one - <span style="font-weight: bold">how does it help McCain to chase off his base?</span>  Yeah, it might have reinforced a &quot;bipartisan&quot; commitment but at that point, why vote Republican?  I think that's a position that makes sense to someone who tends to vote Democrat but makes no sense at all to a Republican (imagine my suggesting Obama should have chosen a pro-life VP, it ain't gonna happen).  Pawlenty, IMO, would have received the same &quot;inexperienced idiot&quot; treatment Palin is getting.<br /><br />But again, I don't want to fall into speaking against my own warning that there's no way to know what would have happened.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I get what you're saying. Maybe where I'm coming from--as someone whose chosen Democratic primary candidate had never, ever won before this year, and who always voted for the Democrat grudgingly--is that the Republican base ultimately would have come home, as they had nowhere else to go. (Barr? Uh-uh. The Constitutional Law Party? Doubt it.) But that's an easier sell to make when you're used to losing than when you're used to winning, so maybe you're right. 
<br />
<br />It was always going to be very tough this year, arguably impossible, for any Republican to both satisfy the base and reach into the mainstream for enough votes to win. I'm sure that if things stay on their current course, there will be all sorts of badmouthing McCain on the right--there is already--but as j-hoya and others have pointed out, he's still running ahead of the generic brand. He must be doing something right.</div>
