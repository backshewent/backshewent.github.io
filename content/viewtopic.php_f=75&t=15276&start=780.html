			<div class="content">There's a difference between what the punditry is squawking about and what the Big O wants. Of course all options are going to be on the table, there's no need to limit strategic flexibility. Quite frankly, we're not going to be able to do much within the five hour timetable that is left for the Ukrainian decision. <br /><br />Obama isn't going to pound the table for military force. He wants his legacy to be the President that extracted the country from two horrendous wars, and my guess is that will be solid through the short term.<br /><br />Strategically, there's really not much we can do, or should do, with the Crimea. Ukraine isn't worth the potential of WWIII, there's nothing we can really do to the Russians in any case. Even if we slap diplomatic and economic sanctions on them, they would likely respond with a nice sell off of T-bills, which would hurt the stock market. I wouldn't be surprised to see them cut off natural gas exports to Western Europe as well, they can sell it elsewhere. <br /><br />Operationally, from a military perspective, the Crimea is just about the worst place in the world to invade. The geography on land and at sea heavily favors the defender. The US can't sail a fleet into the Black Sea without violating significant treaty responsibilities, and the choke point of the Bosporus is easily targeted by long range missiles and bombers. From the land is even worse, as the Crimea is filled with numerous chains of rocky hills and valleys, and setting up a logistics chain would be a complete nightmare as it would involve movement over the Black Sea in some way. Tactically, the Russians could reinforce easily as their lines of communication are far shorter than ours, and the Russian presence in Sevastopol is quite substantial and would lead to another bloody battle (the siege of Sevastopol in WWII by the Germans was brutal and bloody). <br /><br />No, I think there's little to be done here. I would also be surprised if Putin and the Russians don't go after Eastern Ukraine in the next 72 hours as well, and I doubt you'd see much reaction from the West as well. NATO is dead and dry bones at this point, most countries can't even scrape up more than a brigade of infantry.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>Europe and the US should just freeze the money of Russian rich folk around the world. That would end this in about 2 seconds. Of course, that would mean Europe doing without all that Russian cash that they enjoy but pretend not to.<br /><br />I don't think it gets much play, but Russia has a ton of really rich people, even more than you would expect from a country that size. I guess it's all the natural resources which are basically free money. Go to any boarding school in europe and you'll see tons of russians, so much so that most schools actually charge them more than students from other countries (they are also notoriously difficult students).<br /><br />Freeze the assets, that's my call. Let's see how Putin does when the money brokers around him start complaining about their finances being frozen.</div></blockquote><br />Yeah, I think this is a really good, important tool, and something that can be done without hurting ordinary Russians too much. If the people who the Russian state rely on for backing find their money tied up (since most sensible Russians don't keep their money in Russia due to fears that Putin will take it on a whim), there could more hesitation and resistance to moving forward.<br /><br />Congress passed a law recently giving us the ability to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations - <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-20634768" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">US Congress passes 'Magnitsky' rule on Russia trade law</a>. Expanding the list to rope in more big names is something the administration can do by itself, I think.<br /><br />For my longer HOT TAKE - I think 'there will be severe consequences' and throwing one or two possibilities out there is too vague, and the WaPo idea of spelling out consequences would be wise. If Russia does X, we will do Y. If Russia does not immediately withdraw and allow some neutral OSCE forces or whomever to maintain peace in Crimea, we will freeze assets and/or level targeted sanctions on XYZ and/or move to kick them out of the G8 and/or whatever. I do not think Putin respects Obama, or thinks he will follow through on threats. The more specific, definitive and explicit the promise of response, the clearer it is what the costs of his actions will be, and hopefully the higher likelihood that he will stand down. <br /><br />A tremendous amount of world stability is guaranteed with the backing of American force, military and otherwise - through NATO, through treaties, alliances, etc. We, along with the UK and Russians, came to a diplomatic agreement with Ukraine in 1994 that in order to get them to give up their nuclear weapons, the signed parties would respect Ukraine's territorial sovereignty - <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/the-budapest-memorandum-and-crimea/1862439.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">The Budapest Memorandum</a>. It's not a formal treaty, so we don't need to break out the tanks and ships, but the Russians have gone back on their word, and our reaction should be fast and hit them how we can. The reason to react extends beyond this immediate situation. If you're sitting in Tehran or Beijing, you're paying a lot of attention to what Putin is or isn't allowed to get away with here. If you're sitting in Jerusalem or Taipei, you're paying a lot of attention to what the US is doing to live up to its end of the bargain here.<br /><br />I've probably come too far without talking about our allies in Europe, and their culpability in the lack of reaction from the West. Easy to focus on Obama maybe cause I'm not his biggest fan and also because we live here and we carry the biggest stick, but it seems like the Europeans are even more reticent to respond than we are. As others have pointed out there are a lot of phone calls and meetings going on, and it's hard to know what's really happening. For all I know, Obama could be doing a great job trying to round up unanimity among our allies so when sanctions are applied, they carry more weight. If so, good for him, and I would love to have to apologize. Germany in particular looks like they're dragging their feet. Europe has a huge reliance on Russia for natural gas and oil, so any costs will be harder on them than us, but you'd think there'd be a little more concern on their part from Russia extending its influence West by force, especially with former republics now as members of the EU and NATO. Maybe long term planning to develop an infrastructure so we can export some of our new found carbon wealth to Europe might help avoid these crises in the future, but I'm not sure how much that helps in the short term.<br /><br />As I've been typing, I see LG has written a longer post as well. He makes a lot of good points, and knows more about this stuff than I do. I don't think going down the military path is even a little bit worthwhile here, but if we aren't willing to absorb a little economic pushback from a country that is in a dramatically worse position than we are economically to try to ensure stability in Europe, then why should our word be worth anything anywhere ever?</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>Europe and the US should just freeze the money of Russian rich folk around the world. That would end this in about 2 seconds. Of course, that would mean Europe doing without all that Russian cash that they enjoy but pretend not to.<br /><br />I don't think it gets much play, but Russia has a ton of really rich people, even more than you would expect from a country that size. I guess it's all the natural resources which are basically free money. Go to any boarding school in europe and you'll see tons of russians, so much so that most schools actually charge them more than students from other countries (they are also notoriously difficult students).<br /><br />Freeze the assets, that's my call. Let's see how Putin does when the money brokers around him start complaining about their finances being frozen.</div></blockquote><br />Yeah, I think this is a really good, important tool, and something that can be done without hurting ordinary Russians too much. If the people who the Russian state rely on for backing find their money tied up (since most sensible Russians don't keep their money in Russia due to fears that Putin will take it on a whim), there could more hesitation and resistance to moving forward.<br /><br />Congress passed a law recently giving us the ability to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations - <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-20634768" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">US Congress passes 'Magnitsky' rule on Russia trade law</a>. Expanding the list to rope in more big names is something the administration can do by itself, I think.<br /><br />For my longer HOT TAKE - I think 'there will be severe consequences' and throwing one or two possibilities out there is too vague, and the WaPo idea of spelling out consequences would be wise. If Russia does X, we will do Y. If Russia does not immediately withdraw and allow some neutral OSCE forces or whomever to maintain peace in Crimea, we will freeze assets and/or level targeted sanctions on XYZ and/or move to kick them out of the G8 and/or whatever. I do not think Putin respects Obama, or thinks he will follow through on threats. The more specific, definitive and explicit the promise of response, the clearer it is what the costs of his actions will be, and hopefully the higher likelihood that he will stand down. <br /><br />A tremendous amount of world stability is guaranteed with the backing of American force, military and otherwise - through NATO, through treaties, alliances, etc. We, along with the UK and Russians, came to a diplomatic agreement with Ukraine in 1994 that in order to get them to give up their nuclear weapons, the signed parties would respect Ukraine's territorial sovereignty - <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/the-budapest-memorandum-and-crimea/1862439.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">The Budapest Memorandum</a>. It's not a formal treaty, so we don't need to break out the tanks and ships, but the Russians have gone back on their word, and our reaction should be fast and hit them how we can. The reason to react extends beyond this immediate situation. If you're sitting in Tehran or Beijing, you're paying a lot of attention to what Putin is or isn't allowed to get away with here. If you're sitting in Jerusalem or Taipei, you're paying a lot of attention to what the US is doing to live up to its end of the bargain here.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I've probably come too far without talking about our allies in Europe, and their culpability in the lack of reaction from the West. Easy to focus on Obama maybe cause I'm not his biggest fan and also because we live here and we carry the biggest stick, but it seems like the Europeans are even more reticent to respond than we are. As others have pointed out there are a lot of phone calls and meetings going on, and it's hard to know what's really happening. For all I know, Obama could be doing a great job trying to round up unanimity among our allies so when sanctions are applied, they carry more weight. If so, good for him, and I would love to have to apologize. </span>Germany in particular looks like they're dragging their feet. Europe has a huge reliance on Russia for natural gas and oil, so any costs will be harder on them than us, but you'd think there'd be a little more concern on their part from Russia extending its influence West by force, especially with former republics now as members of the EU and NATO. Maybe long term planning to develop an infrastructure so we can export some of our new found carbon wealth to Europe might help avoid these crises in the future, but I'm not sure how much that helps in the short term.<br /><br />As I've been typing, I see LG has written a longer post as well. He makes a lot of good points, and knows more about this stuff than I do. I don't think going down the military path is even a little bit worthwhile here, but if we aren't willing to absorb a little economic pushback from a country that is in a dramatically worse position than we are economically to try to ensure stability in Europe, then why should our word be worth anything anywhere ever?</div></blockquote><br />this, for me, is the main problem that us lefties have with your point and the original article you posted.  the obama is weak narrative is really annoying and often untrue.  you and WaPo are assuming obama is weak even before he does anything at all.  quick responses are good, but so is weighing all of your options and meeting with experts who can help you make an informed decision.  let's wait to see what the white house actually does before criticizing it, okay?<br /><br />as for putin not respecting obama, you think putin really respects anyone?  i doubt there's a person on the planet that he respects.  your original article even pointed out that he's not necessarily acting rationally here.</div>

			<div class="content">On the McCain point, I've concluded that the only real thru-line in his political career is a desperate need for attention. Criticizing the president, whoever holds the office at any given moment, is a pretty good way to draw attention. <br /><br />I do find it chilling to think about how many &quot;interventions&quot; we might have staged had he won six years back.</div>
