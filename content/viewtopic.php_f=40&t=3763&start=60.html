			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>swishnicholson wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>The Red Tornado wrote:</cite><br />okay so Conlin felt he was being sneered at and rightfully so, BUT this excuses what he said?!!  I know my parents never cared who started it, if you hit your brother, youre getting sent to your room.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't think it excuses anything. I was just responding to dajafi's question about where I got the idea that the Blogger's initial email was derisive.<br /><br />My only argument is that with each layer of increasingly less cordial responses, this becomes less of a professional situation of a writer responding to his reader and more of a personal pissing contest between two individuals, and that the causes of this descent into a pissing contest are not strictly one-sided. I think the context of Conlin's remarks thus becomes related less to his conduct of his professional duties and is more akin to a personal conversation.While the standards he is held too shouldn't differ in the two situations, and anyone is welcome to draw whatever unflattering conclusions they want from his words, the justified consequences of his actions CAN change. Conlin should have had sense enough to shut up , and should have had sense enough to use different language to express his distaste of bloggers, but i think he's just being an asshat because he's ticked off, not publicly propagating a deeply held and considered personal belief.<br /><br />Unless you think he really wishes that a new Hitler would arise and put to death anyone who puts out a blog. If so then sure, go for it.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Did you read Conlin's original article?  The first stone was cast there.
<br />
<br />Does he get a free pass for mocking all analytical analysis in there?  Stop being an enabler.</div>

<br />I posted it on TGP, but it reminds me of a couple of lines from Col Nathan Jessip.  He is probably irritated he has to respond to the bloggers.  
<br />
<br />Notice how he says that since he has black friends he can use the N word?</div>

			<div class="content">Because he's not sorry!  He made a bad joke in a one-on-one e-mail, he's probably right in assessing that a bunch of people are making a big deal out of it because they've disliked him for a long time and want to watch him eat some crow while they have the chance.  Everybody mocks the fake apologies ubiquitous in the media these days and now you want one.

<br />Has anyone noted the irony that the previous post on Crashburn Alley is a an argument against political correctness?</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Disco Stu wrote:</cite><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think I'll let the words I wrote after the death of my dear friend and colleague, the former local Associated Press Bureau Chief Ralph Bernstein and the nearly half century relationship my wife and I have had with Ralph and his family through good times and bad represent me against any contrived and baseless attempt to slime me as an anti-Semite. I was a speaker at Ralph's Memorial service. Quite obviously, the Hitler line was used in a satiric response to what has turned into a concerted assault on my Jimmy Rollins column and on my career. It was quite obviously used in a personal e-mail. I did not publish the insulting things said about me. As editor of the Temple University News in 1960-61, I received death threats from the White Citizens Council after writing an editorial denouncing Gerald L. K. Smith and his anti-black and anti-Semitic hate-mongering newspaper &quot;The Cross and the Flag.&quot; I was one of the most outspoken critics of Marge Schott's blatant anti-Semitism to the point some of my columns had to be toned down. Ditto my stand on Al Campanis, a friend, by the way, and Jimmy The Greek Snyder. I also had a long and close relationship with the late, great Dick Schaap, who wrote about my impact on The Sports Reporters at length in his autobiography, &quot;Flashing Before My Eyes.&quot; I am heartened that both a clear conscience and the First Amendment will be at my side.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />This is just a flowery way of saying: &quot;Some of my best friends are Jewish.&quot;  
<br />
<br />That being said, I'm Jewish, and I didn't find his Hitler remark offensive.  If he's saying the only good thing Hitler would have done is kill all the bloggers then, by implication, he's endorsing the fact that killing Jews, gypsies, etc., was not a good thing.  Now that's over-analysis, but it's a natural response to an over-analyzed situation.
<br />
<br />This whole contretemps is a tawdry and childish waste of time.  As Wizlah pointed out with his bear analogy, the original emailer went looking to pick a fight and he got one.  Having tweaked the bear's nose, he got the expected angry response.  What a surprise!  Then he and all the other kids run around saying: &quot;Oooh!  Look how bad the big, bad bear is reacting!  Let's go tell the Ranger to shoot the bear!&quot;  Then the bear is reduced to pleading that he's really a good bear.
<br />
<br />It's all just schoolyard taunting on one side and a bully throwing his weight around on the other.  For all his self-aggrandizement, Bill Conlin is just an old sportswriter living on his reputation (such as it is).  And, for all their high-mindedness, all his taunters have done is elevate him -- and lowered themselves --  by giving him his words an importance which they don't deserve.
<br />
<br />Conlin was wrong about one thing.  It's all not a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.  By lowering all those involved, it's less than nothing.</div>

<br />
<br />The First Amendment isn't even relevant here.  It protects free sppech from Government interference.  That's not even close to being the case here.  I learned that in journalism school back in the late 70s and I still remember it and I wasn't even a good student.  Jeez, I think I'm pretty much done with Conlin but he really must know this.</div>

<br />
<br />I was just about to comment on that, I just about spit my beer out.
<br />
<br />I do not like the guy and I also don't believe he should be fired for something like this. I do think he should lack a job just because he is basically washed up and is out of the business of creative thinking(I think I view this pretty similar to dajafi). He can still write just fine and even with some elogance at times, but his brain gets in the way.
<br />
<br />I don't believe he is an anti-semite, I just think he is a nasty guy that said something that was intended to be nasty and hurtful, but really came off as stupid and hateful. 
<br />
<br />The thing is, there are many bloggers out there that Conlin should want no part of getting into a war of words with, because a lot of bloggers out there are simply better writers. Also are capable of even more witty nastyass biting sarcasm(that doesn't come off as hateful but smacks home real hard with certain truths that Conlin probably doesn't want to consider).
<br />
<br />Conlin as a guy who has no business being paid to write about sports anymore probably should start his own blog.</div>

			<div class="content">I should point out here that I also don't think Conlin is an anti-semite--and, despite my post on p. 1 of this thread, I haven't even written anyone at the Daily News yet (and might not at all) to complain. 
<br />
<br />Conlin's an ignorant, mean-spirited jerk whose knowledge declines even as his arrogance and self-satisfaction increases. But this almost feels like kicking him when he's senile, if you get my meaning. On some level, like Vox, I don't want to see him go down for a dumb, offensive remark; I want to see him go down on merit. (This is doubly true of Hayes, btw; while Conlin was probably consistently good at some point, and has written columns fairly recently that were of decent quality, Hayes has never shown himself as anything but a boorish, untalented hack.)
<br />
<br />On the other hand, while I don't think he's an anti-Semite, I do think what he wrote was pretty offensive. The blatant message was that he thinks bloggers are worthless, which is vicious but just the opinion of one thesaurus-owning blowhard; the operational component was that on some level he wishes a strong man will put them all to death. (I assume he'll be supporting Rudy Giuliani in the upcoming election.) That's belligerent.</div>

<br />
<br />Are you kidding me?  Whether this should get him fired makes no difference.  And sending email is not a private exchange.  Anyone can do anything with an email sent to them.
<br />
<br />However, this IS how Conlin is.  This isn't the faux facade that you may have seen in a public comment.  This is how he feels and acts.  He hates bloggers and sends them emails wishing death on them.  If you think, for any reason, that the blogger should have kept that secret or that Conlin may have said it differently if done publicly, you are as much as an enabler as I have seen.  The blogger has no responsibility to someone who wishes he was dead and for Conlin to think (or anyone in that matter) he does is incredibly naive.
<br />
<br />You are also ignoring the fact that Conlin is sending these types of emails out to the general public, regardless of the cause.  You are about as far off base as you can get.</div>
