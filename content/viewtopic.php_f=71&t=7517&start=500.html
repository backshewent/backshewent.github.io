<br />Clearly, the solution is that we send shock troops of consumption, known as marketing professionals, overseas to convince the Chinese and Europeans that there lives will be unfulfilled and unless they spend more money on stuff America wants to sell them. Surely, Woody, you and your ilk can convince a billion Chinese that in order to be a real man, they need a Silverado.</div>

			<div class="content">Looking at some of the details that as far as I know haven't yet been worked out, I stand to come out pretty well in all this. Mrs. Vulture wants a new house, and one version gives us 15k for that, while another version would only have the tax credit for new homebuyers. Also, we still haven't pulled the trigger on a second car, and apparently, there's some money there for that. I wonder if it would apply to used cars, or new cars only....</div>

			<div class="content">I don't think either of them would be thrilled to realize this, but Paul Krugman and <a href="http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/the_trouble_with_centrism.php" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Ross Douthat</a> are sort of saying the same thing today: mindless centrism hurt the stimulus on the merits. I won't bother quoting Krugman--you pretty know what he said without having to read it (though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/opinion/09krugman.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">here's the link</a>)--but here's Douthat: 
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>...[C]entrist Senators exist to take politics as usual - whether it's tax cuts in Republican eras, or spending splurges in Democratic ones - and make it ever so slightly more fiscally responsible. So if the GOP wants, say, $500 billion in tax cuts, the country clearly needs $400 billion in tax cuts - but not a penny more! And if the Democrats want $900 billion in stimulus, then the best possible policy outcome must be ... $800 billion in stimulus! To read this Arlen Specter op-ed, justifying both the stimulus package and the cuts the &quot;gang of moderates&quot; have attempted to impose, is to encounter a mind incapable of thinking about policy in any terms save these: Take what the party in power wants, subtract as much money as you can without infuriating them, vote yes, and declare victory. <br /><br />Now fiscal responsibility is generally a good thing, and so a centrism mindlessly focused on tweaking legislation away from deficit spending has its uses. But what Nelson, Collins, Specter and Co. have done isn't a new kind of politics. It's the definition of politics as usual. And in this particular case, there's a reasonable argument that it's actively pernicious - that if you can't shrink the stimulus package much more substantially than the centrists have done, you shouldn't shrink it at all. There's a case to be made for a stimulus that's radically different than the one we have now; there's a case to be made for a stimulus that's like the one we have now, but a great deal smaller and more targeted; and there's a case to be made for a stimulus that's absolutely gargantuan. But thanks to the centrists, we're getting the cheapskate version of the gargantuan version: They've done absolutely nothing to widen the terms of debate about what should go into the bill, and they've shaved off just enough money to reduce its effectiveness if Paul Krugman is right - but not nearly enough to make it fiscally prudent if the stimulus skeptics are right.  </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I agree with this, but I imagine that from the Obama/Democratic perspective, if the choice is either a bill flawed by the fruits of &quot;mindless centrism&quot; or no bill, they open Door #1. Letting the Republicans block the bill is a loser for them politically as well as, if you believe in the merits of the bill, on substance. 
<br />
<br />The other consideration is that this is how our system works: things get diluted. Douthat's point about tax cuts holds here: I remember in early 2001 the new Bush administration proposed $1.6 trillion in cuts, the Democrats in the Senate shaved $250 billion or so off of it, and from my perspective as a Democrat I thought, &quot;okay, that's at least something.&quot; From a system perspective, there's value in feeling that the minority still has some influence.</div>

But we're trying to take action here to stimulate demand--your government is on the case, and we're going to get through it together.&quot;  <br /><br />Pretending that things are swell is an excuse for doing nothing. Now, Werthless has made it pretty clear that his preference is essentially to do nothing. That's fine as a political position, but at least try to honestly explain why it's the best course of action. <br /><br />I think the idea of the stimulus package is to provide a bridge holding up demand until credit starts flowing again--which the administration is hoping their new bailout plan, to be announced tomorrow, will accomplish. The problem is that Obama didn't explicitly present it that way; he tried to be too cute by half and include &quot;a down payment on long-term growth.&quot; Personally I'm strongly in favor of those kinds of investments in sustainable energy, education reform, improving the performance of the health care system, etc. But it's a fair point to argue, as Werthless did last week, that those things should get separate consideration.</div></blockquote><br />It takes someone to agree with me for you acknowledge the merit.  Even when I post something you agree with, you find the need to be dismissive.  Your close-minded is revealed.  <br /><br />Going back to econ 101, inflationary expectations DO influence inflation.

<br />No, I don't agree with your political point.  I think Americans realize this problem results from the Bush programs and economic philosphy.  Those that don't hold this view are unlikely to be convinced by Obama rhetoric.  At most, it is a political change around the edges that may buy Obama a bit more time/patience as he deals with the problem and may, again really nibbling around the edges, help Congressional Dems a little in the 2010 elections.  As for Obama himself -- either the economy is viewed as 'fixed' in 2012 and he is almost certainly re-elected, or the economy still looks frightening in 2012 and he is defeated.  In other words, he will be judged on the ultimate results and how he paints the picture today is not going to significantly help or hurt him.  The American people have some degree of patience, sensing the depth of the problem, but this is not the 1930s, we no longer have 4 years of patience.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>I don't think either of them would be thrilled to realize this, but Paul Krugman and <a href="http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/the_trouble_with_centrism.php" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Ross Douthat</a> are sort of saying the same thing today: mindless centrism hurt the stimulus on the merits. I won't bother quoting Krugman--you pretty know what he said without having to read it (though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/opinion/09krugman.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">here's the link</a>)--but here's Douthat: <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>...[C]entrist Senators exist to take politics as usual - whether it's tax cuts in Republican eras, or spending splurges in Democratic ones - and make it ever so slightly more fiscally responsible. So if the GOP wants, say, $500 billion in tax cuts, the country clearly needs $400 billion in tax cuts - but not a penny more! And if the Democrats want $900 billion in stimulus, then the best possible policy outcome must be ... $800 billion in stimulus! To read this Arlen Specter op-ed, justifying both the stimulus package and the cuts the &quot;gang of moderates&quot; have attempted to impose, is to encounter a mind incapable of thinking about policy in any terms save these: Take what the party in power wants, subtract as much money as you can without infuriating them, vote yes, and declare victory. <br /><br />Now fiscal responsibility is generally a good thing, and so a centrism mindlessly focused on tweaking legislation away from deficit spending has its uses. But what Nelson, Collins, Specter and Co. have done isn't a new kind of politics. It's the definition of politics as usual. And in this particular case, there's a reasonable argument that it's actively pernicious - that if you can't shrink the stimulus package much more substantially than the centrists have done, you shouldn't shrink it at all. There's a case to be made for a stimulus that's radically different than the one we have now; there's a case to be made for a stimulus that's like the one we have now, but a great deal smaller and more targeted; and there's a case to be made for a stimulus that's absolutely gargantuan. But thanks to the centrists, we're getting the cheapskate version of the gargantuan version: They've done absolutely nothing to widen the terms of debate about what should go into the bill, and they've shaved off just enough money to reduce its effectiveness if Paul Krugman is right - but not nearly enough to make it fiscally prudent if the stimulus skeptics are right.  </div></blockquote><br /><br />I agree with this, but I imagine that from the Obama/Democratic perspective, if the choice is either a bill flawed by the fruits of &quot;mindless centrism&quot; or no bill, they open Door #1. Letting the Republicans block the bill is a loser for them politically as well as, if you believe in the merits of the bill, on substance. <br /><br />The other consideration is that this is how our system works: things get diluted. Douthat's point about tax cuts holds here: I remember in early 2001 the new Bush administration proposed $1.6 trillion in cuts, the Democrats in the Senate shaved $250 billion or so off of it, and from my perspective as a Democrat I thought, &quot;okay, that's at least something.&quot; From a system perspective, there's value in feeling that the minority still has some influence.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />My god could I not possibly disagree with that guy more than that... Specter and the Maine ladies are heroes, not mindless centrists. You've got two positions, both hopelessly wed to their own method of how to solve the problem, neither willing to bend. And then you have the grownups who come in and say, well gee, neither is going to get 100% &quot;their way&quot;. Of course the Dems should get MORE of what they went in the bill reflecting their party's strength, but where can we find some parts of the bill that are probably Dem overreaches and take those parts out. &quot;Mindless centrists&quot; more like &quot;mindless bloggers&quot;.</div>

If you think the stimulus is irrelevant or harmful, that's one thing, though you're pretty far out on the fringe in that view. <br /><br />The other argument--that the bummer-language rhetoric is, or at least is supposed to be, instrumental in getting the legislation passed, and that Obama is betting that the legislation will have far more impact on what happens with the economy than his words in a given news cycle--seems to be lost on you. As does the point that Obama's electoral chances are probably much more tied to the actual performance of the economy (the correlation between GDP growth and presidential election outcomes is very well documented) than to his ability to make an I-told-you-so claim or blame Bush or anyone else who came before. <br /><br />The more I think about this, the more I don't believe the politics were handled very well. Obama probably should have come out of the gate characterizing the stimulus as part one of a two-part recovery scheme, part two being the revised bailout provisions. And maybe he should have broken out the long-term investments from the short-term measures in the stimulus package itself, though I get the rationale in doing that part the way they did. But this is the picture that's emerging now. If it works, or if the economy turns around anyway, he'll probably win re-election. If it doesn't, he and the Democrats probably go down over the next two cycles.</div></blockquote>
<br />I think the specific content of a stimulus plan is fairly irrelevant in the short-term goal of avoiding a catastrophe.  Obviously, what is in the plan specifically will have a significant impact on how the economy and nation look 10 years from now.  For the short term though, the degree of stimulus is determined only by: 1)how much additional money the government injects into the economy, 2)what fraction of that money is spent, not saved, and spent on domestic, not foreign, goods and services, and 3) how quickly that money is provided and I guess the speed at which it is spent.  Werthless adds a 4th point, that the success of the stimulus also depends on how much the people believe it will work.  This gets at the confidence factor, which is a 2nd problem in addition to loss of demand that must be made up by stimulus.  I can readily believe that an $800 billion stimulus plan with all Washington hands, media, and Wall Street behind it and saying it is likely to solve the problem might well be as effective as a $1.6 trillion stimulus in the present climate of doubt, partisan bickering, and frankly Wall Street not wanting the economy to turn around until they have extracted the maximum amount of government rent that they think possible (in other words, let's not sink the ship, but we really want to be left on a high mountain and not this deep hole we find ourselves in, and well, we do hold the economy hostage as we have amply proven.)</div>

<br />
<br />But that implies there was a rationale behind making the cuts they made--other than raw political calculation--which I think must have determined what stayed and what got tossed. I haven't seen anyone saying that they were surgically targeting &quot;overreaches,&quot; even before you consider that's inevitably in the eye of the beholder. 
<br />
<br />What I think you're saying is that the centrists acted to force the appropriate political solution, in which the plan is 58 percent Democratic and 42 percent Republican (I'm simplifying since that's the approximate Senate breakdown). I see the logic, but what Douthat's arguing is that this detracts from the plan on its merits, pretty much whatever you think of it.</div>

<br />
<br />I get it on the politics (though from the perspective of the Democrats, I'm sure they felt they'd compromised enough already--hence the complaints about watering down the House version, Obama &quot;negotiating with himself,&quot; etc). That was my point about how our system works; I can happily live with that, and I think sites like Talking Points Memo and columnists like Krugman are missing the big picture. But that doesn't mean the plan is &quot;better&quot; as a result of the compromises.</div>

<br />
<br />I hear that. The process of governing in our system, which was designed to make it very hard to take big steps, exacts a price in loss of focus/consistency/efficiency. But it's held up pretty well on balance. 
<br />
<br />This is kind of a change of subject, but I do worry that the sophistication of interest-group politics and the difficulty of taking big steps could really hurt us when it comes to formulating a response to something as big, and as unrewarding as far as short-term political outcomes, as climate change. So many people have so much invested in the status quo that it's going to be almost impossible to respond at the scale the problem demands.</div>

<br />You ever listen to the business commentatiors on business news cable?  Whatever bailout/interest rate cut/stimulus is always overestimated as to what they think it should be in advance and if the government doesn't pony up to the expectation, then the traders tank the market the next day.  And yes, I think the banks will lend after they have extracted the last possible bailout $.  They have told they are vital, too big to fail, the only ones who can get us out of this and they are now standing athwart the bridge the economy must pass over.  The ransom?  How many of their bad paper mistakes will the taxpayer take off their hands for far more than they're worth.  The review of bailout Part I says the government overpaid by tens of $billions.  Who do you think is pocketing those $ as they clamor for more?  When Chrysler was bailed out, Lee Iacocca worked for $1/year.  No such humility today.  Money up front, please, if you want your economy back.</div>

<br />
<br />Yeah, that was what bothered me--the tradeoff of aid to states, which would be ameliorative in the sense of avoiding deep, deep cuts to education and human services that (so the defenders of this provision hold, and I agree) would undercut the more explicit stimulus provisions.
<br />
<br />Your characterization of the politics might be correct, but given the timing of state budget deliberations--here in New York at least--&quot;later&quot; would have to come pretty soon.</div>

The process of governing in our system, which was designed to make it very hard to take big steps, exacts a price in loss of focus/consistency/efficiency. But it's held up pretty well on balance. <br /><br />This is kind of a change of subject, but I do worry that the sophistication of interest-group politics and the difficulty of taking big steps could really hurt us when it comes to formulating a response to something as big, and as unrewarding as far as short-term political outcomes, as climate change. So many people have so much invested in the status quo that it's going to be almost impossible to respond at the scale the problem demands.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I think Jeff's point is that an attainable good is better than the unattainable perfect. Now, you could say that Specter et al should just go along with the Democrats plan, but that would be a huge waste of political leverage. Specter, for one, got some money for medical research that will benefit Pennsylvania. And it might very well be that his performance in all this has persuaded Toomey not to put up a primary challenge.</div>
