<br />
<br />are you attempting to make an argument, or just providing a weak & interpretable-in-various-ways correlation?
<br />
<br />Because one could say that a passive approach to things economic - with respect, say, to securities regulation - by other Republican administrations has had equally deleterious effects on businesses, and provide equally ambiguous reference points in defense of the assertion.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>are you attempting to make an argument, or just providing a weak & interpretable-in-various-ways correlation?<br /><br />Because one could say that a passive approach to things economic - with respect, say, to securities regulation - by other Republican administrations has had equally deleterious effects on businesses, and provide equally ambiguous reference points in defense of the assertion.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I admire your pedagogical instinct, doc, but I think it's probably to no good end. <br /><br />That outlays for Social Security and Medicare are larger than they were in 1980 is obvious, but if the point is what businesses could expect, there haven't been huge surprises--other than I guess the advent of projected additional zillions (on the card, natch--like the wars and everything else under Bush) for Medicare Part D.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it seems pretty clear that Obama has about as much enthusiasm for this whole job creation enterprise as I do for doing laundry: <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Obama said that while he appreciates the need for federal investment to fight the nation's high unemployment, private business, not government, holds the key to future job growth. &quot;Ultimately, true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Instead, Obama and his economic advisers, concerned about balancing the need to create jobs against the need to reduce the deficit, have focused on measures in which they can use government money to leverage private investment.<br /><br />&quot;I think the president is between a rock and a hard place here,&quot; said Carl Schramm, chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation. &quot;There were a lot of good ideas, but all of them cost money, and that is something the president doesn't have.&quot;<br /><br />John Podesta, a close Obama ally and a chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, echoed that theme, saying Obama is caught between the need to create jobs and other economic challenges.<br /><br />&quot;Trying to get something going, particularly quickly, the range of options is constrained by the fiscal picture in the country,&quot; Podesta said after the forum. &quot;Trying to find that sweet spot is difficult.&quot;<br /><br />Obama defended his economic policies, saying that they have helped pull the economy from the brink of disaster, while dramatically slowing the pace of job losses and fostering growth for the first time in a year.<br /><br />But with the nation's jobless numbers projected to rise for months, he acknowledged that more must be done. Obama said he is &quot;not interested in taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to creating jobs.&quot; Yet, he repeatedly returned to his point that the ability of the government to spur job creation is &quot;limited.&quot; </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Again, I think he's probably right. Temperamentally if not ideologically, this is a pretty conservative president.</div>

<br />
<br />Well, you brought up Nixon. I mentioned Johnson because he had arguably the most ambitious/interventionist domestic policy agenda ever, yet the economy roared while he was in. 
<br />
<br />I thought the point you're arguing was that new government activism--changes and interventions with spending implications during a presidential tenure--is what spooks the (mostly fictional in any event, IMO) far-sighted and rational businesses you're concerned with. If this is the case, higher expenditures on old programs, where spending is determined by formulas and demographic changes, should be factored in to projections of future conditions, no? 
<br />
<br />If you're merely saying that Nixon's (fitful and inconsistent) interventions into the economy confused and concerned the business community, I don't have a quibble with that; you'll have to find some other grounds for an argument, or someone else to argue it with.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>

<br />
<br />More interesting at any rate, which I guess is close enough to fun. 
<br />
<br />Myself, I'm just trying (not always successfully, as jeff will tell you) not to be dogmatic about any of this stuff. There are times for intervention and times to sit on your hands. To an extent I share (what I perceive to be) Obama's annoyance that irrational/political short-term considerations are getting in the way of staying on what strikes me as a prudent and sensible course. 
<br />
<br />As I've probably written here many times, my entire hope for the Obama administration is that it can restore the good name of pragmatic liberal governance that's principled, but equally rational, modest, and skeptical. That I think the country is on an unsustainable course (maybe &quot;parallel unsustainable courses&quot; is a better way to put it) renders the stakes really high. That our president is basically a Vulcan gives me some confidence that he'll be able to stay on course.</div>

			<div class="content">Interesting (and to me encouraging) <a href="http://prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=12&year=2009&base_name=let_obama_be_obama#117620" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">exchange from the &quot;Jobs Summit&quot; yesterday</a>: 
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>    Robert Kuttner: Most of the things that have been proposed today cost money, and there is this concern about the federal deficit.<br /><br />    I hope that your administration will recognize, as I know you will, that it's possible, first of all, to reduce the deficit over time and sometimes in the short run realize that you need to increase the deficit. And I hope the concern about the deficit in the long run doesn't crowd out the need for additional spending in the short run.<br /><br />    And I also think that some of these programs that increase jobs and increase GDP are probably the fastest way to get the economy back on a track that will reduce the deficit over time. It's certainly a better way to reduce the deficit than putting ourselves into a debtor's prison and assume we can deflate our way to recovery.<br /><br />    President Obama: Well, I think this is an important point. You know, we've been talking a lot about specific initiatives. There is a macroeconomic element to this whole thing. And so let me just amplify what was just said.<br /><br />    We have a structural deficit that is real and growing, apart from the financial crisis. We inherited it. We're spending about 23 percent of GDP and we take in 18 percent of GDP and that gap is growing because health care costs, Medicare and Medicaid in particular, are growing. And we've got to do something about that.<br /><br />    You then layer on top of that the huge loss of tax revenue as a consequence of the financial crisis and the greater demands for unemployment insurance and so forth. That's another layer. Probably the smallest layer is actually what we did in terms of the Recovery Act. I mean, I think there's a misperception out there that somehow the Recovery Act caused these deficits.<br /><br />    No, I mean, we had -- we've got a 9-point-something trillion-dollar deficit, maybe a trillion dollars of it can be attributed to both the Recovery Act as well as the cleanup work that we had to do in terms of the banks. In turns out actually TARP, as wildly unpopular as it has been, has been much cheaper than any of us anticipated.<br /><br />    So that's not what's contributing to the deficit. We've got a long- term structural deficit that is primarily being driven by health care costs, and our long-term entitlement programs. All right? So that's the baseline.<br /><br />    Now, if we can't grow our economy, then it is going to be that much harder for us to reduce the deficit. The single most important thing we could do right now for deficit reduction is to spark strong economic growth, which means that people who've got jobs are paying taxes and businesses that are making profits have taxes -- are paying taxes. That's the most important thing we can do.<br /><br />    We understand that in this administration. That's not always the dialogue that's going on out there in public and we're going to have to do a better job of educating the public on that.<br /><br />    The last thing we would want to do in the midst of what is a weak recovery is us to essentially take more money out of the system either by raising taxes or by drastically slashing spending. And frankly, because state and local governments generally don't have the capacity to engage in deficit spending, some of that obligation falls on the federal government.<br /><br />    Having said that, <span style="font-weight: bold">what is also true is that unless businesses and global capital markets have some sense that we've got a plan, medium and long term, to get the deficit down, it's hard for us to be credible, and that also could be counterproductive. So we've got about as difficult an economic play as is possible, which is to press the accelerator in terms of job growth, but then know when to apply the brakes in the out-years and do that credibly. </span>And you know, we are trying to strike that balance, but we're going to need help from all of you who oftentimes are more credible than politicians in delivering that message.<br /><br />    Because we want to leverage whatever public dollars are spent, and we are under no illusion that somehow the federal government can spend its way out of this recession. But it is absolutely true that any of the ideas that have been -- been mentioned here are still going to require some public dollars, and those are actually good investments to make right now.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Emphasis mine. Tough trick, for sure.</div>

			<div class="content">If we were to even approach getting the deficit down, that really doesn't change the national debt and the burden it imposes on the economy. Unless you expect the budget to not only balance but to start on a runaway plus trajectory. At this point with a war going on, universal health care being debated, and social security and medicare for baby boomers coming up, I think a reduced deficit is pie in the sky thinking right now.....but do they ever still talk about a balanced budget amendment?</div>

<br />I read somewhere that due to low interest rates, even though the debt is high, the percentage of the budget that debt service takes up is lower than it has been in 30 years or something.  Until interest rates go up again, then the government is screwed.</div>

			<div class="content">I'd trade Grayson for Bachmann. Especially if they could have a reality show together after getting the boot. 
<br />
<br />They do kind of perfectly capture the problem with how governance and media intersect now: two unserious attention whores with no evident interest in legislating but undeniable skill for pushing buttons can help drive the agenda and push matters of substance out of the public eye. 
<br />
<br />I'll admit to giving Grayson a big huzzah the first time he mouthed off, and he actually did something important and admirable before running for office at least. But, as Jon Stewart might put it, he's not really helping, particularly as a member of a large majority. The rationale for grandstanding is a little stronger for the side out of power.</div>

			<div class="content">Trying to decide how much I agree with this take on the healthcare debate, from Kevin Drum of Mother Jones. Obviously there's something to it, but the question I guess is whether one's point of comparison is the status quo or what might have been achievable had different tactics been employed: 
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Democrats have been trying to pass a universal healthcare plan for nearly a century. But Woodrow Wilson dropped the ball on the first attempt, FDR gave up on the second, Harry Truman ran smack into the AMA on the third, Richard Nixon collided with Teddy Kennedy on the fourth, and Bill Clinton fell to Harry and Louise (and Bob and Newt) on the fifth.<br /> <br />Now we're on our sixth try, and the fight so far hasn't been a pretty one. The Republican side has been dominated by howling over death panels and socialism, transparently fake attempts at bipartisanship, and promises to filibuster and obstruct endlessly. On the Democratic side, activists have turned abortion funding and the public option into hills to die for, Olympia Snowe and Ben Nelson have become de factor kingmakers, and even at best none of the bills on offer will cover more than about two-thirds of the uninsured.<br /> <br />But you know what? This is still the farthest we've ever gotten, and with Democrats coming out of this week's series of negotiating sessions seemingly united behind a compromise plan, it looks like Harry Reid might actually get something passed through the Senate before Christmas. If that happens, a conference committee will likely report out a final bill sometime in January. And that will be the first time ever that Congress has even gotten to the point of voting on national healthcare.<br /> <br />The first time. So yes: It's not single-payer. The subsidies are inadequate. The public option, if there is one, will be so weak as to be a joke. Every interest group from insurers to doctors to seniors to pharmaceutical companies has been openly bribed to go along. Lots of people will still be left outside the safety net. It's a mess.<br /> <br />But so was Social Security when it passed. It left out domestic workers (because they were mostly black and Southerners demanded it), it left out farmworkers, and its payouts were pathetically small. But what it did do was establish the principle that the elderly should be taken care of. And eventually they were. The healthcare bill we're about to get is exactly the same: It does too little and it leaves too many people out, but it establishes the principle that everyone deserves decent healthcare. And eventually everyone will.<br /> <br />So hold your noses and celebrate anyway. It's taken us a hundred years, but if this messy, inadequate, infuriating healthcare reform passes it will be a historic occasion. FDR will finally be smiling.</div></blockquote>
<br /> 
<br />The point about Social Security is a really good one: the initial form of a law isn't what it has to be forever.</div>
