The war on terrorism appears to be perpetual, as there will always be terrorists no matter what we do or how many drones we launch. Therefore there’s no justification for an endless war in which American citizens can be targeted for execution. And this memo makes a case for such a plan: killing anyone who’s accused of committing or plotting to commit a crime in a vaguely-defined war.<br /><br />If the administration opts to continue this policy, it should be compelled to lay out a timeline or clear ending to this war and thus an end to the president’s war powers enabling his use of drones against citizens, as was the case with Lincoln and Roosevelt. Or, if this is to be an ongoing process, like law enforcement, then we have to treat it accordingly and place restrictions on what techniques can be used, just as we do with law enforcement and due process.<span style="font-weight: bold"> Specifically, the president shouldn’t be allowed to kill citizens without due process outside the confines of a declared war with a stated ending.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Anything short of this action will allow the administration — and, more menacingly, future administrations — to retain massive, unaccountable and extrajudicial executive power that could be used in far more dangerous ways, and into the foreseeable future</span>. The notion that executive officials, including the president, could endlessly (and I underscore endlessly) hand down death sentences against American citizens ought to be shocking to anyone regardless of how they feel about the president’s accomplishments or his level of greatness.<br /><br />I totally understand the justification for drones as a weapon: chiefly that they prevent the deaths of American soldiers and pilots. On the surface and used with extreme discretion, it sounds like a safe way to hit back against an opposing military force. <span style="font-weight: bold">But a risk-free weapon (price tag aside) must be used sparingly because common sense tells us that the temptation to abuse such a risk-free privilege is so great that the lure of its convenience could very easily spiral out of control into the unthinkable.</span> A predator drone is an amazing example of American military technology, but it should be used with equally amazing discretion — used as sparingly as a piloted aircraft or a battalion of soldiers.<span style="font-weight: bold"> And so there must be legally-imposed restrictions on how they’re used, otherwise it’s easy to see how the use of drones could expand into all varieties of constitutionally unsavory areas, and I’m sure a clever team of White House lawyers could fashion a slippery justification for each one</span>.</div></blockquote></div>

They're bad and morally objectionable in different ways, but also both arguably necessary for national security and so worth doing. If you want to place them on a single, two dimensional spectrum of anathema-tivity I don't think we're shifting further down the spectrum so your lack of knowing what to say means we have to agree to disagree.</div>

			<div class="content">I can see the need/logic for some of these drone strikes, but I don't see how this should be some endless power that the president and his counsels get to decide in perpetuity. We have a court that decides if an american can be wiretapped, why can't there be a court that puts a check on the Prez's drone strikes? The other court is done in secret, but at least it offers some form of check on what could be a very scary power in the wrong hands.<br /><br />Of course, one side or the other would end up trying to pack the court with warmongers, but you get my point. There needs to be a check on a power this absolute and deadly. We wouldn't accept some Joe Schmoe cop acting outside the law and killing criminals because he thought they were a threat without any proof and we shouldn't accept this.</div>

			<div class="content">jh, fair enough.  It's not really worth arguing about anyway because it's really just semantics.  My real point is that there's nothing substantive in that memo that precludes the use of drones within US borders.  I'm not exactly an expert on US/international terrorism law/law of war, but I do know legal boilerplate CYA when I see it.  And I've read the memo... it contains no substantial discussion regarding the importance of the person being outside US borders.  It throws that in as a modifier of the issue but does nothing to suggest that the analysis would be altered if the person is within US borders.<br /><br />Read it for yourself.  <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf</a><br /><br />Now perhaps the reliance on <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hamdi</span> should make me feel better (acknowledges that US citizen as enemy combatant still has DP rights), but it doesn't.  That should be a case that works AGAINST the argument in favor of drone strikes, but the memo uses <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hamdi</span> to bolster its argument, which is ridiculous.  The memo even compares its scenario with the DPC analysis in domestic situations where law enforcement shoots a fleeing person who poses a serious threat to the officer or others.  So do you really think that's an enormous leap?<br /><br />Seriously, I feel like the people who are disagreeing with me on this point haven't read a single bit of the memo.  Please, read it.  It's not terribly easy reading (but not the toughest legal brief ever either) and it's 16 pages.  I'd be happy to be wrong and say that there's something in there that clearly changes the analysis if applied to US citizens inside our borders (not that it should even matter), so please find something in there.</div>
