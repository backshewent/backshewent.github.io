			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Bucky wrote:</cite>as to the discussion at at hand:<br /><br />incredibly stupid.  i actually think it's a bunch of techno id10ts not realizing the risk in what they're doing, DESPITE clicking through their mandatory security training.

What's our groupthink on that</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, yes and no, to me anyway. As much as she's been honest about anything, it's that she didn't want her emails open to scrutiny for any personal or political details, which she felt would happen in using the official server (probably right to think that would happen). Of course the reasonable but slightly inconvenient way to do that would be to separate professional and personal emails completely. But I don't think she's even capable of separating the personal, political and professional in her life. It is, as you say, stupid to think the personal email could be secure enough (although official emails don't have that  great a track record either), and probably even more stupid to think the system would never  be questioned, since somewhere down the line someone is bound to be interested in what the State Department's been up to,even from an historical perspective. So there was some intent to cover up, but probably not any specific dealings. It's just the way she lives her life.<br /><br />I never had a  great interest in the case anyway though, since it's origins were with the Benghazi investigation. The search and seizure that ensued had nothing to do with the original bogus case anyway and should never have held even the possibility of criminal charges. It was a witch hunt with probably the best possible outcome, in that it exposed a risky and misguided practice but from which we can (hopefully) move on to the next distraction.</div>

It's pretty amazing that Trump and the rest of them are pushing the narrative to blame the FBI for not indicting when they have so many easy soundbites about Hillary lying and that she did have classified information, that was classified at the time, on the servers.

			<div class="content">clinton:<blockquote class="uncited"><div>did not send classified material and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified</div></blockquote><br />if the 110 emails were received as part of a chain, she's not incorrect.  but you know, i guess you don't have to agree with that framing. that's fine.<br /><br />comey: <img src="./images/smilies/cryingeagle.gif" alt=":ce:" title="Crying Eagle" /> <blockquote class="uncited"><div>It is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked “classified” in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.</div></blockquote><br />this is what the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/fbi-findings-damage-many-of-hillary-clintons-claims.html?_r=0&referer=http://bluenationreview.com/revelation-of-classified-marking-error-supports-hillary-on-emails/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">NYT</a> has found:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Among those was the fact that “a very small number” of emails sent on her server bore markings that indicated they were classified, contradicting not only previous statements of Mrs. Clinton’s but also claims by the State Department that none had.<br /><br />While he did not identify any, he was evidently referring to two emails that one of Mrs. Clinton’s close aides, Monica R. Hanley, sent to prepare her for telephone calls with foreign leaders, according to a State Department official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.<br /><br />One email, dated Aug. 2, 2012, noted that Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, was stepping down as special envoy trying to mediate the war in Syria. A second one, sent in April 2012, discussed Mrs. Clinton’s call to the newly inaugurated president of Malawi.<br /><br />Each was marked with a small notation, “(C),” indicating it contained information classified as “confidential.”<br /><br />Other paragraphs in the note about Mr. Annan’s resignation were marked “(SBU),” for “sensitive but unclassified.” That designation appears in more than 1,000 of the 30,000 work-related emails that Mrs. Clinton turned over to the State Department, including some later “upgraded” to higher levels of classification. The official said that the notations were part of “a standard process” when preparing a phone call, which would be “confidential” until it occurred and then considered unclassified.<br /><br />Far more serious were those that were unmarked, according to Mr. Comey. He referred at one point to eight chains that were classified as “top secret,” and at another point to seven with the additional designation as “special access programs.” Only a small number of officials are allowed access to those programs, which are the nation’s most sensitive intelligence operations.<br /><br />Mr. Comey did not detail any of the information contained in the emails, but the State Department announced in January that it would not release to the public 22 emails contained in seven chains of emails and replies, even in a redacted form, as thousands of others have been over the last year. Those emails have been widely reported to include information about the Central Intelligence Agency’s program to use drones to track and kill terrorism suspects.</div></blockquote><br /><br />comey as prosecution is compelling (sans a rebuttal from a defense, which he declines to provide clinton due to the public shaming without recommending indictment) but it's frankly immaterial if he didn't recommend charges. one might wonder, as mobettle has, why he didnt when he spent 14 minutes railing against her. it's likely to prevent the country from going through it and because no one would be able to convict her of anything of consequence. also, there's some good political benefit he derives should he ever need it in the future. he's only 55, after all.<br /><br />fwiw, he erred in one of his statements:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>State Dept spox Kirby just now says two emails that Comey said were 'marked classified' were wrongly marked, and were not classified</div></blockquote><br /><br />those were the two i mentioned above, fwiw.  so known were actually MARKED as classified, they contained info. without opening i'm not sure how you know.  once you see it, you are to handle it correctly. she violated policy by having a server. having your own server is pretty stupid, and goes into my next portion.<br /><br />now ,this is certainly where moma can be upset:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In the handling of classified information, however, any carelessness is cause for concern. Mr. Comey noted that people who are careless often face administrative punishment, echoing some officials at the State Department who have privately suggested that a similar misstep could severely harm their careers.</div></blockquote><br />perhaps we should reform how we approach classification and our internal response to it more than anything. i've been for the former for a long time; it might've prevented many unnecessary secrecy.  <br /><br />now, the clinton camp's response has been deafening; almost literally. they've said nothing and the few surrogates they've put up have been stumbling and bumbling. they appear to not have read near as much as those who chose not to recommend indictment and simply make her look worse.   i'm not sure beyond what she's already said she could say that would be enough for people, though. i don't think this makes her 'uqualified'. there was no malice or ill-intent, it was a secretive move because she didnt want people to read her emails to use them against her, because they would. i think it shows what we've already known; she's responded to years  and years of undue criticism in a secretive manner that further feeds it and helps create legitimate criticism. this the clintons in a nutshell. unfortunately it will be 4 years more of it.  But, people call President Obama 'No Drama' but if you were to ask half the country they'd say he was the worst, most corrupt president we've ever had. there's no winning and THAT is why I think the Clintons do this stuff; they think they'll be criticized anyway so they don't think about what the legitimate criticism would be, either. <br /><br />i'm voting for her and would suggest others close to my political persuasion would too because i think she will be a competent president to run our country but i wouldn't imagine it'll be a fun 4 years. it's not like the past 7+ have been roses. it never is, it's politics.</div>

			<div class="content">When I said 'lying', I meant 'what she said was incorrect'. It's quite possible she had no intent of sending/receiving classified information on the server and just couldn't recall 100 emails out of 30k+. Still, it is certainly not a good look.<br /><br />Not that this issue is going to sway many people either way...it just gives Republicans a somewhat unfortunate talking point. She'll have to address it somehow and I'm sure their team is figuring out the best way here. Mostly contrition I'm sure with a promise that the lesson was learned, there were no real world consequences, and her administration will be extra vigilant in protecting our country's most sensitive information. The servers were a mistake, and one of convenience and out of 30000 emails, 100, one third of one percent contained classified information. Then later you can move onto the fact that Donald Trump come August will be receiving classified briefings regularly and find some clip/story of him leaking things to the press or hell, the one where he called in pretending to be someone else and is this who you want to be trusted with the most secure information in the United States?</div>
