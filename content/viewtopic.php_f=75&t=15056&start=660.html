			<div class="content">The feds have to pick and choose how strongly to enforce federal laws. They operate on a limited budget and have to make hard choices about the most efficient way to allocate resources. You wouldn't want the feds doing everything possible to catch every person speeding or underage drinking (or w/e a federal law would be that would apply there) would you? <br /><br />The percentage of Americans that really care about the govt enforcing weed, speeding, underage drinking etc is very low, so they can get away with it. That isn't the case with access to abortion and gay marriage. Not enforcing a law that takes a way a right (No weed) is also different than not enforcing a law that gives a right (right to abortion). If the state ignores the law that takes away weed, I'm pretty sure (not 100%) the only &quot;person&quot; that has standing to sue is the feds, not the case with banning abortion.</div>

Yeah, there is something annoying about having different states with different laws, even ones that have laws that contradict federal ones, but states' rights is part of what this nation was founded on and it's one of the primary ways that progressive legislation gets recognized on a national level.  The optimist in me thinks weed will be legal nation wide in 2016 once everyone sees that WA and CO have not fell into a munchie-induced coma, and have actually gained revenue from taxing and selling marijuana.  However, I'd be shocked if weed were still illegal nation-wide after 2020.</div>

			<div class="content">I understand that argument, and it is the logical response in defense of the DOJ's position.  I don't think my objection is so much to the <span style="font-style: italic">actuality</span> of the DOJ's decision not to emphasize enforcement of federal marijuana prohibitions in Colorado & Washington, but rather to their <span style="font-style: italic">announcement</span> that they intended to suspend enforcement.  You don't want to allocate your resources to marijuana crime?  Fine, if you quietly reassign agents to other cases and make no public comment.  <br /><br />But validating states that &quot;go rogue&quot; and openly defy federal laws by announcing that you will do nothing in particular to assert the primacy of federal law?  That's an open invitation to South Dakota to outlaw abortion, to Mississippi to suspend the civil rights act, etc.  I realize that the DOJ will not permit some of these things to go on, but they open themselves to a perfectly legitimate question in those cases: if the people of Washington & Colorado can essentially void federal laws they disagree with, why can't the people of any state do the same, regardless of the law they are voiding?</div>

They put up a protest vote and did not demand that he get rid of something they previously lost on. There is a difference and you know that.</div></blockquote><br />Government shut downs happen all the time, many of times at the hands of the Democrats. In fact, it's happened when Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and executive branch (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdown_in_the_United_States#Federal_government" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">list of shutdowns</a>). What's your point that the situations were not identical?</div></blockquote><br />yes, the democrats in the 80s were terrible.  what does this have to do with 2013 again?</div></blockquote><br />Where you stand on an issue depends on where you sit. The whole &quot;This is an unprecedented and evil move that YOUR party is doing&quot; talk is annoying. I don't even support the GOP position on this (they don't really seem to not have a coherent and attainable objective), but what it comes down to is this:<br /><br />1. In the short term, we should be increasing the debt ceiling so that government can continue to operate.<br />1a. GOP are jackasses for trying to stop this without a reasonable ransom (we're not undoing Obamacare this week).<br />1b. Administration are jackasses for attempting to inflict maximum damage of shutdown on American people.<br />2. As it's happened a dozen times in the last few years, Congress wants to extract concessions to push back debt ceiling.<br />3. Presidents are relatively powerless against this budget impasse, in that they cannot clearly unilaterally act.<br />4. Obama didn't support debt ceiling raises in his past life as a Senator. Congresspeople are often stupid self important people who are less interested in an effective/efficient government than they should be.<br />5. New GOP folks are trying to govern according to the will of the people in their district that elected them. Since they often ran on anti-goverment platforms, what they are doing is not surprising at all. It may even be considered in their political self interest, even if it's not in the self interest of the collective US.<br />7. We need some systematic reform of how Congress deals with debt ceilings. Both parties seem unwilling to legislate them away. In principle, since Congress also controls the budgetary process, there is no reason to have a debt ceiling law unless it is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">deliberate attempt to create an opportunity for this very grandstanding to occur</span>.<br />8. We must always pay our debt.<br />9. We must always pay our debt or we're fucked.</div>

I don't think my objection is so much to the <span style="font-style: italic">actuality</span> of the DOJ's decision not to emphasize enforcement of federal marijuana prohibitions in Colorado & Washington, but rather to their <span style="font-style: italic">announcement</span> that they intended to suspend enforcement.  You don't want to allocate your resources to marijuana crime?  Fine, if you quietly reassign agents to other cases and make no public comment.  <br /><br />But validating states that &quot;go rogue&quot; and openly defy federal laws by announcing that you will do nothing in particular to assert the primacy of federal law?  That's an open invitation to South Dakota to outlaw abortion, to Mississippi to suspend the civil rights act, etc.  I realize that the DOJ will not permit some of these things to go on, but they open themselves to a perfectly legitimate question in those cases: if the people of Washington & Colorado can essentially void federal laws they disagree with, why can't the people of any state do the same, regardless of the law they are voiding?</div></blockquote><br />The executive branch cannot, according to the Constitution, decide which laws passed by Congress they choose to enforce. <br /><br />This only matters if you care about following the Constitution over doing what you think is right.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I agree that the letter-of-the-law requires equal enforcement of all laws on the books, but, in practice, we all know resources are limited and until unlimited ones are finally invented, there will always be a certain degree of &quot;emphasis&quot; involved (i.e., picking your battles, etc.)<br /><br />Having said that, I don't think the DOJ should announce that it intends to waive enforcement of this or that law, particularly in reaction to a state's repudiation of a particular law. I think principle has to matter for something, and if you believe (as I do) that the federal government's laws take primacy over state laws, and that states are not free to do whatever they damn well please, you are obligated to lay the smack down against a state that decides to openly deft federal law, even if they are doing so on a point you may agree with (as I agree that marijuana should be legal).<br /><br />I anticipate that a response to this would be that the only way any national politician would ever be willing to spend political capital on something ultimately as trivial as legalizing marijuana would be if the states had all but done so already and it became more a matter of repealing a blue law than repealing an actively enforced statute. Though this may be true, my feeling is: too bad.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The main difference is in the two examples, abortion and voting rights, there is an identifiable person who has lost their civil rights or civil liberties. Failing to enforce marijuana laws does neither.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Depends on if you believe a fetus has civil liberties, doesn't it?</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite>The whole &quot;This is an unprecedented and evil move that YOUR party is doing&quot; talk is annoying. </div></blockquote><br /><br />I'm no historian, but I believe in important ways this situation may be unprecedented.  This is a situation where a minority faction of a minority party is holding a gun to the Speaker's head refusing to allow him to bring to the floor a motion which is favored by the majority of Americans, a majority of the House, a majority of the Senate and which the President would sign.  Worse yet, except for the Speaker, the major players have no political skin in the game.  The President's already been re-elected and the Tea Party Republicans will likely not suffer any political consequences for their stance.  As John McCain said on the floor of the Senate yesterday, the government will be reopened, the debt ceiling will be raised, but there's no path to get us there.  It's a political perfect storm.<br /><br />I'm willing to assume the Tea Party Republicans' stance regarding the ACA is principled.  And I know the President's stance is.  However, the President's principles go beyond just saving his signature legislation.  If a minority faction of a minority party can overturn legislation passed by both houses, signed by the President and ratified by the Supreme Court by holding the very functioning of government hostage, it turns the entire principle of our majority-rules government on its head.  We may as well be a Republic where, in order to form a coalition, minority positions of minority parties are conceded just to allow the formation of a nominally governing coalition. When the Speaker, et al, call for negotiations regarding the ACA it's really a thinly-disguised call for re-negotiations since those negotiations happened three years ago, after which the ACA was signed into law.<br /><br />To me, as principled as the Tea Party's position may be, that position is trumped by the larger principle of majority rules.  If the Tea Party wants to reopen debate on the issue and try to convince a majority of both houses and the President that changes should be made, that's their prerogative.  But to try to achieve that result by holding the government and the debt ceiling hostage would create a precedent which would threaten our system of government.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>td11 wrote:</cite>so basically GOP is responsible for shutdown, but administration is to blame for enforcing it</div></blockquote><br />Can you quote me where I've criticized the President on this, outside of 1b in the above post, which refers to the first post on page 28? <br /><br />You may be surprised, looking through my posts, that I haven't criticized him on the debt ceiling stuff. (Only that he stupidly advocated for not renewing it when he was a Senator). I haven't posted in this thread in a while, until Pacino made of fun of a position that Rand Paul has that I thought many liberals on this board would support.<br /><br />I agree with the abovementioned post that jerseyhoya made, that it's kind of ridiculous some of the stuff that the administration is doing to close monuments that previously needed no staff, block off the shoulders of roads around Mt Rushmore so people can't pull over and look at it, etc, but the President doesn't have a ton of influence on Congressional budgetary and process. Congress takes most of the blame, although I can't think of anything that the President has done in the last few months that deserves praise. The President's lack of leadership on this particular issue isn't very surprising, and I think the GOP should have had a better plan to exact reasonable concessions.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yesterday, Rand Paul tweeted that the solution to the debt ceiling crisis is for the United States to “cut up the credit card and balance our budget.”<br /><br />Interesting, considering how since 2009, the budget has been balanced more rapidly than at any time in modern history. A congressman from Florida, Dennis Ross wrote yesterday, “For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row.” Ross is a Republican who supports a the passage of a clean continuing resolution, and Politifact declared his statement to be unequivocally “TRUE.” Of course it is.<br /><br />The deficit, specifically related to Paul’s call for a balanced budget, has declined by more than 50 percent and, by the end of the president’s second term, it will have dropped to around two percent of GDP. That’s superb especially considering the deficit was a record $1.4 trillion four years ago.<br /><br />As for the debt, do we really need to do this dance again? Yes, the debt is high, continues to rise and long-term debt will eventually become problematic. But why is the current debt so high? Several things, according to CBPP and Bloomberg: two wars during the Bush years; the Bush tax cuts; the Great Recession; and the bailouts (TARP, the stimulus, etc). So if the GOP is this radically against long-term debt, why didn’t they speak up years ago? A question for the ages.<br /><br /><img src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-29-cbpp_debt_chart.jpg" alt="Image" /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thedailybanter.com/2013/10/in-which-i-explain-to-debt-ceiling-and-financial-apocalypse-to-rand-paul-and-sarah-palin/">http://thedailybanter.com/2013/10/in-wh ... rah-palin/</a><!-- m --></div>
