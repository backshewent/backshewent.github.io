It didn't really work very well as we were still trying the whole &quot;they can cry themselves to sleep&quot; which didn't work so well when she was doing it at the bedroom door. (True story--she actually did fall asleep on the floor by the door, until we opened the door (which opened inwardly) and woke her up to start the whole process over again. <br /><br />All I can say is that bed time issues were only a struggle for three or four years after that.</div>

			<div class="content">So my daughter went to a birthday party at a trampoline and climbing wall park and she did really well with the wall, being the only kid to make it up the wall and it's her first time. That's the good part.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she came home with a sore back. She's 7 y.o. I figured she pulled her back struggling up the wall and didn't worry much about it. She said it was sore for a few days, then it seemed to get better before she aggravated it the other day reaching down to pick something up off the floor. We took her to doctor today for her vaccines and they did a normal check-up. We didn't even mention the back thing because she hasn't said anything about it, but then the doctor noticed her spine is crooked. They did an X-ray and her spine is curved at an 11 degree angle and her one shoulder is lower than the other when she's just standing. They also noted that she's very flatfooted, which I thought was weird because she has fairly high arches and none of her previous doctors have noted it. They diagnosed scoliosis, but we're going to get a 2nd opinion. We told the doctor about her coming home sore from the climbing wall, but they put that in the box of things that could be caused by the scoliosis. Maybe this is correct, but I wonder if she hurt her back climbing and that a muscle spasm is causing the curve in her spine. My brother has back spasms and his spine was all over the place, as did my wife. We never noticed our daughter standing strange and she is standing quite strangely. Hard to believe we would miss that, so it's almost hard to believe she has scoliosis that would cause such obvious symptoms without us noticing. <br /><br />I don't know which is worse for a 7 year old, scoliosis or an injured back, so I don't know what to hope for. Then I went on the internet to find causes and treatments for the scoliosis and scared myself to death because Muscular dystrophy is one of the causes and it made me think about her flatfootedness and how muscle weakness is the first symptom of MD. So now I'm freaked out.</div>

In the useless words department, try to not to worry but still do everything you need to get a satisfactory answer.

It's such a scary thing and difficult to look at. My daughter was actually measured at 13.5 degrees (my wife said 11, but the paper says 13.5), but she is only 7 y.o.. Outcomes also tend to be worse for girls, but I'm hoping it doesn't get worse. Doing some quick figuring based on her age, gender, and degree of curve, it looks like she's about a 70% chance to need a brace at some point and maybe around 40% to need surgery. That's an estimate, of course. I think you're probably right about the muscle spasms. It's more likely that she got hurt because of the scoliosis than the other way around. We made an appointment at another doctor later in the week and we'll see a specialist when we come back to the states. We have great insurance here, except if we go to the states (no coverage) because the US is soooooo expensive and most international schools won't cover anything there except for emergencies. If she needs more extended care, we may go to Thailand or Korea for a specialist, which would be pretty crazy.</div>

			<div class="content">well got some good news about my daughter. We took her to another place today. We decided to not tell them about the other diagnosis and just tell them that her back has been hurting since using a climbing wall. Two different doctors looked at her back and said they didn't see a problem. They even did the thing where she leans over and took a look at her back. There didn't appear to be a curve or anything. They didn't do an x-ray though and instead prescribed a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory thing. I think it's basically tylenol in a patch form. The other place said she should come back in a year for another x-ray, but we'll take her back there in 4 months and get another x-ray to see if the curve is still there. She's not standing weird anymore, so I think it was just a muscle injury. Fingers still crossed, but this is very good news. It matches with the fact that we've never noticed any crookedness to her gait or shoulders.<br /><br />exhale.</div>

You shouldn't mock peoples' names.  It is not the person's fault what their name is.<br /><br />However, when you name your kid what they named their kid, then you have to expect your kid to have their name mocked.  <br /><br />They weren't making fun of the kid, they were making fun of the parents for being assholes and setting their kid up for a lifetime (or at least 18 years) of mockage.  After the kid turns 18, if they don't legally change their name, then they are fair game.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I wonder whatever happened to that kid named ESPN.</div>
