It's almost like they want it to fail. They just can't have it look like government can help solve society's problems. The moment it looks that way, their whole ideology falls apart.</div></blockquote><br />You=bad at reading comprehension.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />You= good at missing the point.<br /><br />I got that we were supposed to &quot;imagine&quot; it. I just don't think you picked a ridiculously high number by accident.</div></blockquote><br />You misinterpreted everything. I picked 50 hours intentionally because it is easy to imagine how behavior can be affected at such levels. It's hard to talk about how behavior is affected unless we pick a number that will impact a large amount. It's like if I say &quot;increasing the price of gas by $0.10/gal tax will decrease consumption,&quot; it might be tempting to say &quot;no way, if you have to drive, you'll drive.&quot; But when you think about how you would be affected by a $10/gallon tax, you can easily visualize how behavior would be affected. Well, the $0.10/tax may affect people, but in very small magnitudes. Maybe 1 out of 50 people change their behavior (ie. combine errand trips to limit distance) with $0.10/gal tax, but it still has an economic effect.<br /><br />But getting back to health insurance, anything that is not &quot;seamless&quot; will lose people on the margins. If it takes 8 hours, then you're going to get people to say &quot;I'll deal with this later.&quot; Maybe they do, maybe they don't. If it takes 2 hours, then someone learns that their cost would go up 50%, they might say &quot;I'll deal with that later.&quot; Again, maybe they do, maybe they don't. As you increase the cost, in time investment, you're going to get more people dropping out along the way. It's easy to imagine at 50 hours, but harder to imagine at 2 hours. My uncle is lazy, and because he doesn't have dependent, I could totally see him not getting around to signing up if it's a big hassle. I'm not calling it rational or irrational, but it's just the way it is.<br /><br />Your second comment is a misinterpretation, but I'm not sure you care. So I'll let that rest.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />So it was a thought experiment. Ok, but picking 50 hours is so far beyond what is happening that I don't think it's worth thinking about it that way. It's like thinking about being fat by thinking about weighing 2,000 pounds. OMG, my legs would be crushed beneath me! When you go to such ridiculous extremes, it ceases to be relevant. Even Boehner, as much as he wanted it to take forever, only took an hour or two (more because he wouldn't take the healthcare guy's call, but that wasn't Obamacare's fault). I spent hours and hours trying to get insurance under the old system. Taking 2-3 hours to get insurance seems exceedingly easy based on my experience.<br /><br />But you're right that I did misinterpret some of your post. So my bad on that.<br /><br />For what's it's worth, I think you probably underestimate how much people want health insurance. I couldn't get health insurance for a while because I had some weird eye thing that they couldn't figure out. Then I had to have some procedures done and I had to pay it all out of pocket after visiting the ER. I would have run through a brick wall to get insurance. Yes, there are those who will give up after a few hours, but those are a small minority, imho. Many more people are being scared off by GOP scare tactics and that is just sickening, again, imho.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>As for the Supremes taking up the birth control mandate: If they strike it down, does that mean people can sue if they don't like where their tax money goes? Serious question. Isn't this a bit of a Pandora's Box? If so, I'm cutting off the defense department on the grounds that killing people goes against my Christian upbringing and beliefs.</div></blockquote><br />No. Not a lawyer, but if memory of my wife's law school classes serves me right, I believe that hippies brought a suit in this vein to defund their contributions to the Vietnam War. Obviously lost.<br /><br />I havent read the birth control case, but I am fairly sure they are making a different argument than &quot;we don't like where our tax money is going.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />But they are basing their argument on the fact that they are morally opposed to practice. Aren't they?<br /><br />Assuming I'm right about their argument, I don't think it's a big stretch to say that someone morally opposed to war might try to make the argument that they shouldn't have to pay for that war. In both cases, they are being forced to use some of their income to pay for services that benefit the larger populace, services they don't use and are morally against.<br /><br />Again, this is more of a question because I'm not a lawyer and have no interest in playing one on TV. I know it's not as simple as my post would indicate.</div>

			<div class="content">Private health insurer Humana surveyed Medicare eligibles in 2013 on, among other things, how much time they typically devote to making Medicare coverage decisions.<br /><br />Average (hey, there are exceptions) hours spent on that item reported by people who DO compare their options: 22. Hours. Annually. So the 64-yr-old Congressperson Boehner may have been quite near the low end of time spent by &quot;choosers&quot; in/near his age cohort.<br /><br />My hunch is the figure is actually more like 22 minutes, if that, when ALL Medicare eligibles, choosers and non-choosers, are in the mix. Still not 50 hours. But not nothing. I must admit I have no idea what's taking them so long, availability of web info or no.<br /><br />Coming from another perspective, prominent health economist Alain Enthoven has noted that people typically spend more time selecting wine at a restaurant than they do on their choice of employer-sponsored health coverage. So there's that.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite>It's probably the better health care that is leading to fewer readmissions and lower costs.</div></blockquote><br /><br />That would make sense. The chart makes a relatively small readmission rate decline look bigger than it is, and the period is pretty brief too. I don't doubt the change is technically significant, and reducing hospital readmissions can probably be counted on to have disproportionate impact on costs. But the magnitude of change to date is not easy to gauge from the information provided.  The passage containing the highlighted text is not well-written.</div>
