Just a piece of paper where you bubble in your choice then drop it into the machine (shredder?). Easy peasy. Probably to accommodate all the old people. I was the youngest there by like 40 years I think. <br /><br />There were probably 30 people ahead of me in line at 7am. Nobody really after I walked out. This is actually the first time I've gone to an actual place to vote. (And only the second time voting ever)</div>

Wright School at 28th and Dauphin Streets, the polling place for the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th divisions of the 28th Ward. Some time after 7 a.m., he said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> a carload of men wearing white hats with &quot;Trump&quot; emblazoned on them stopped at the school.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;It was five or six guys who got out and looked at who was voting,&quot; Scott said. &quot;There was no conversation, no confrontation. They just looked, then left.&quot;</span></div></blockquote><br />i bet they talk big at the bar later tonight</div>

Because as pac said it seems very secure. However the lady was so old and was signing people in like 5 at a time it seemed and the line I thought got out of order so I have no idea if my vote was attributed to me or someone else. Oh well.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />votes and voters are not linked at any time.</div></blockquote><br />This is correct.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This was poorly worded. What I should have said was I'm not entirely sure who seemed to be running things because it seemed like I could have easily gone in and voted again. There was no organization provided by any of the poll workers.</div></blockquote><br />didn't you sign a little book? if you signed the book it'd be hard to vote again</div></blockquote><br /><br />i was thinking it'd be pretty easy to just walk up and into a machine and keep voting.  The lady was just like &quot;you signed?  alright, this one is empty!&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />at my precinct once you vote the poll worker has to reset the machine to take another vote</div>
