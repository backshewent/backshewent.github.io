			<div class="content">Alright, that's it, I'm in, just for this, I'm in. BASEL II? You're citing as a symptom of the decline of American Republic Basel II? I dare say I know more about Basel II than anyone else on this board. Basel II, while a gigantic pain in the ass for virtually every bank in the world, is NOT a bad thing. It's at WORST equivalent to Sarbanes-Oxley, and that's stretching it. 
<br />
<br />Why on earth would you want to elect someone to come up with Basel II or similar types of docs. Not everything can be elected, it takes too long, and frankly, not enough people, especially those interested in political science have any clue what they're doing when it comes to financial markets, so let the grownups talk and sit in the corner of the room.</div>

<br />The much celebrated balanced budget, for which both Bubba and congressional republicans can justly claim credit, was NOT the cause of our economic success.

<br />When you look at the Clinton administration, even beyond the sleaze, you see imcompetence and cronyism and a level of corruption that Bush's buddies cannot broach.  Now, most of that is due simply to Clinton's incompetence, not a deliberate attempt to steal from the governed.
<br />
<br />On balance, even without the impeachment, Clinton's was a failed presidency.  Not on a Nixon or a Carter level, but still a failure.  The ill-considered attempt at socialized medicine, the neglect of the military, the giveaways to North Korea, the blind eye to genuine threats from the Middle East, Donna Shalala -- abject marks of failure.

<br />
<br />I'm with you halfway through.  I agree that Clinton's biggest success is where he worked with the Republican Congress but generally moderation is best and only achieved through compromise.  
<br />
<br />I also agree that very little credit or blame goes to a President for the economy.  In my view, the economy is largely cyclical and the most the President can do, or should try and do, is extend a good wave or shorten a depression.
<br />
<br />But then you get conclusory again.  I know you say that Clinton was incompetent and corrupt yet I have never seen the widespread condemnation of an administration for corruption and incompetence as this one.  Note this is not simply the &quot;liberal MSM&quot; but from a litany of Bush I and Reagan prototypes.  Do you believe that their corruption is just more reported and obvious?
<br />
<br />Certainly, Clinton had failures and I generally agree with those that you listed.  But every administration, especially two term ones have failures.   You mentioned JFK... failure to pass the Civil Rights Act,  the Bay of Pigs debacle, certainly the same personal moral failures as Clinton.  Those failures seem much more disastrous then those you listed by Clinton.</div>

<br />
<br />No, no, no, no, no. This is nothing like the Clinton impeachment. And it doesn't even have to do with the disastrous failures of this administration--the war, the inequality, the conscious polarization of the country, the silence and inaction on so many big problems. 
<br />
<br />TP, I like you and I respect you. But I think you simply couldn't be more wrong about the Bush Gang. I won't claim that they're a criminal enterprise... though I do think they've broken a lot of laws. But I agree with Paul Krugman that they're a &quot;revolutionary force,&quot; who have a very different view of how our government works than anyone who came before them. It's called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">unitary executive theory</a>. 
<br />
<br />This administration claims powers no previous president has even contemplated. The incidence of <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/003457.php" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">&quot;signing statements&quot;</a> that essentially nullify laws passed by Congress; the president doesn't have that power. The decisions to wiretap, to shrug off the Geneva Conventions, to rescind habeas rights that predate the Constitution, going back to the Magna Carta. You say they're powerless; that's not true, but it's also not the point. 
<br />
<br />They've given us the thoroughgoing politicization of government, putting partisan hacks like <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/12/special-counsel-calls-for-firing-lurita-doan/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Lurita Doan</a> and <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/benchconference/2007/06/why_does_this_guy_still_have_a.html?hpid=topnews" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Bradley Scholzman</a> and hundreds more whose names we might not ever know, all helping to make what seems to be the modern Republican philosophy--&quot;government is incapable of serving the public, so let's use it to reward our friends and punish our enemies&quot;--a self-fulfilling prophesy. 
<br />
<br />What's really scary to me about this, and why I think it aligns with Phan Paul's concerns, isn't so much what Bush and Dick are doing; it's what the next guy or gal could do. Rudy Giuliani is every bit the sociopath with an authoritarian streak that Dick Cheney is. Hillary Clinton isn't at that level, but she does have a big appetite for power and a sense of entitlement that's not so far from Bush's own. 
<br />
<br />They've opened the door to some terrible things. To this point, those things mostly have just happened to unlucky Muslim detainees, insufficiently partisan U.S. attorneys and other public servants, and members of a few additional groups. But it's the nature of power unchecked to keep reaching. Whether it's this Bush, or the next Clinton, or Rudy, or some charismatic nut now in a state legislature somewhere, someone will go through the door, unless we nail it shut. At that point, the country we loved probably will be gone.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>TomatoPie wrote:</cite>Dub and Dick and Karl are not Nazis, the Antichrist, nor even evil incarnate. Their governance pales next to the Clintons, to Nixon, and to LBJ in terms of corruption and misuse of power.<br /><br />Today, Dub is powerless.  Does that not speak to the separation of powers and checks and balances?<br /><br />Relax, this is nothing.  You are gonna look back and say &quot;what was I so exercised about?&quot; just as I now say to myself over the Clinton impeachment.</div></blockquote><br /><br />No, no, no, no, no. This is nothing like the Clinton impeachment. And it doesn't even have to do with the disastrous failures of this administration--the war, the inequality, the conscious polarization of the country, the silence and inaction on so many big problems. <br /><br />TP, I like you and I respect you. But I think you simply couldn't be more wrong about the Bush Gang. I won't claim that they're a criminal enterprise... though I do think they've broken a lot of laws. But I agree with Paul Krugman that they're a &quot;revolutionary force,&quot; who have a very different view of how our government works than anyone who came before them. It's called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">unitary executive theory</a>. <br /><br />This administration claims powers no previous president has even contemplated. The incidence of <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/003457.php" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">&quot;signing statements&quot;</a> that essentially nullify laws passed by Congress; the president doesn't have that power. The decisions to wiretap, to shrug off the Geneva Conventions, to rescind habeas rights that predate the Constitution, going back to the Magna Carta. You say they're powerless; that's not true, but it's also not the point. <br /><br />They've given us the thoroughgoing politicization of government, putting partisan hacks like <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/12/special-counsel-calls-for-firing-lurita-doan/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Lurita Doan</a> and <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/benchconference/2007/06/why_does_this_guy_still_have_a.html?hpid=topnews" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Bradley Scholzman</a> and hundreds more whose names we might not ever know, all helping to make what seems to be the modern Republican philosophy--&quot;government is incapable of serving the public, so let's use it to reward our friends and punish our enemies&quot;--a self-fulfilling prophesy. <br /><br />What's really scary to me about this, and why I think it aligns with Phan Paul's concerns, isn't so much what Bush and Dick are doing; it's what the next guy or gal could do. Rudy Giuliani is every bit the sociopath with an authoritarian streak that Dick Cheney is. Hillary Clinton isn't at that level, but she does have a big appetite for power and a sense of entitlement that's not so far from Bush's own. <br /><br />They've opened the door to some terrible things. To this point, those things mostly have just happened to unlucky Muslim detainees, insufficiently partisan U.S. attorneys and other public servants, and members of a few additional groups. But it's the nature of power unchecked to keep reaching. Whether it's this Bush, or the next Clinton, or Rudy, or some charismatic nut now in a state legislature somewhere, someone will go through the door, unless we nail it shut. At that point, the country we loved probably will be gone.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Naturally, the admiration and respect is mutual. I still don't share your fears, and it's not out of any defense of Dub. I think the hue and cry about Dub and co is grossly overblown. That said, it serves a purpose, again in that &quot;checks and balances&quot; thing. There are just too many lawyers and too many bloggers for any one interest to get too far out of hand with power.  And what Dick Cheney has done to suspected terrorists is a day in the park compared to what Lincoln did and to what FDR did.  And we bounced back from those times pretty well and we generally regard Lincoln and FDR as among our greatest leaders.</div>

<br />Brief synopsis:  &quot;I have a different understanding with the president&quot;, circumventing proper channels, 9/11, eavesdropping and stoopid FISA, Cheney's tax cuts, getting around the law (the Ruskies after the space shuttle disaster), influencing a criminal probe, letting Bush think he's calling the shots, Cheney's secretive task force on energy policy, Cheney's &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; on economic policy, executive supremacy, Gitmo, &quot;we don't torture&quot; (because we've redefined what torture is), the stoopid Geneva Conventions, etc.</div>

<br />
<br />Please tell me you aren't seriously going to defend Citizen Dick. 
<br />
<br />The guy is a menace to your Constitution as much as mine. He claims executive privilege to hide secrets, and then turns around to argue he isn't part of the executive branch and thus isn't subject to its rules. Oh, and tried to shut down the department that was pushing him to disclose. 
<br />
<br />He's a hard-to-believe conflation of the worst judgment (&quot;last throes,&quot; torture, et al) and the worst morality of any public figure in my lifetime. At least Nixon was often right in his policy instincts.</div>

<br />Meanwhile, though I'm not generally an advocate of hate-the-rich politics, since my big objective these days is to see Hillary Clinton defeated, I hope that the more hardcore Dems to my left take note of how many corporate bigshots are lining up behind Our Lady of Perpetual Triangulation.</div>
