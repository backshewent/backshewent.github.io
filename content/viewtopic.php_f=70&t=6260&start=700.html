<br />You're right.

<br />The Weathermen were a bunch of fucking deluded morons so incompetent they wound up blowing themselves up (and good riddance). The S&L criminals were tremendously effective in ruining peoples' lives and earning a massive government bailout paid for by you 'n' me.

<br />
<br />Do you think he really helps in Colorado? As far as I can see, it's the only Mountain state that's really up for grabs. I suppose Romney might help in Nevada, but that's still only 5 evs. 
<br />
<br />I sort of see the Michigan thing, but again, I don't see it mattering all that much.

			<div class="content">It seems like McCain really wants to pick Lieberman. But either he (because he's pro-choice) or Romney (because he's a Mormon) potentially puts some of those hardcore social-issues voters at risk, and neither guy really helps on the economy: Romney knows his stuff, but he comes off as a rich guy with a compassion deficit, and Lieberman has no domestic record to speak of. (This probably doesn't bother Republicans, but the only thought I have of him with respect to economic issues was his total lack of interest in looking into Enron and other bad corporate actors when he was in a position to do so as a committee chair in 2002.)
<br />
<br />Pawlenty talks the talk on domestic issues, would sit fine with social issues voters, and might help in his home state. But they're evidently scared Biden would carve him up in a debate, probably with reason. Romney, for all his other issues, is a very smart guy and probably could debate Biden to a draw. 
<br />
<br />I'm starting to think the genius pick for McCain would be Kay Bailey Hutchinson. She has no policy profile to speak of and has never struck me as an especially magnetic political personality. But she'd provide cover for the truly enraged Hillary voters, and I'd argue there's a non-negligible chance that Biden would say something truly egregious or offensive if he had to debate her. 
<br />
<br />The other really interesting pick would be Huckabee, but I just don't see McCain going there.</div>

He's a better option than the other names that have been floated recently.<br /><br />Plus he'll more than hold his own with Biden in the debates, which probably is the biggest impact event(s) for VP candidates on the overall outcome of the election.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Do you think he really helps in Colorado? As far as I can see, it's the only Mountain state that's really up for grabs. I suppose Romney might help in Nevada, but that's still only 5 evs. <br /><br />I sort of see the Michigan thing, but again, I don't see it mattering all that much. <br /><br />I think it hurts the Republicans in VA and maybe even NC.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />As much as a VP candidate can help in an election, which is probably somewhat minimal, Romney would be a help in Colorado.  He's very popular in the state, especially with the hard-core conservatives including those on the religious right.  This latter group might be a surprise to some, but in Romney probably isn't the liability with the religious right that some (like Huckabee) make him out to be.  Colorado is so closely contested that a 1% bump, which I could see Romney providing, may very well be the difference in McCain's ability to win the state.  Same for Nevada and New Mexico.
<br />
<br />While I don't think he'd be a net positive in VA or NC, I don't see him costing McCain votes either.</div>

<br />
<br />About the most fun political race I could ever imagine would be Palin vs. Brian Schweitzer for the presidency. Both westerners, more or less libertarian, great personalities. 
<br />
<br />(Then again, I thought this one was going to be fun and uplifting, and it's sucked just as hard as they usually do. Probably until we do away with all the consultants on both sides, this will continue to be the case.)
<br />
<br />But just as this wasn't Schweitzer's year, I think you're right that it isn't Palin's either. The fact that they're both from tiny states population-wise also suggests it would be tough for them to win a nomination, if they ever tried for it. Thinking about it, the last nominee from a low-population state was McGovern; that didn't work out real well.</div>

<br />I was thinking Palin too, but she just had a baby a month or so ago, so don't know if she'd want to embark on a campaign right now.  Also, she's caught up in a probe of her official conduct (abuse of power) at the moment, so that likely takes her from consideration.</div>

<br />
<br />He doesn't suck. But he comes across as extraordinarily fake in my opinion. His willingness to change positions at the drop of a hat for the sake of political expediency isn't a likable character trait. Plus he's rich as hell and owns many more houses and the media will blather on about that because it's dumb enough that they can understand it.
