But the election is not today. The election is in November. Honestly, i don't believe many of the claims that I see in the polls that a supporter will vote for 1 candidate only, and not vote otherwise if someone else wins the nomination. With a current President at 50+% unfavorability, they will come out.<br /><br />This article from 2016, which I randomly googled from years ago, reminds me that Kerry and Hillary Clinton were nominated when primary voters sought to be smart, and Obama was nominated when electability was ignored.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/2/11/10966832/sanders-owes-donald-trump">https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/2/11 ... nald-trump</a><!-- m --></div></blockquote><br />I think your first paragraph makes things worse for Sanders relative to the rest of the field based on the article, not better, though not sure that was what you were arguing. <br /><br />On the second point, if you're suggesting voters may not be the best judges of which candidates are more or less electable, I would not disagree (some polls currently have them saying Sanders is the most electable, after all). But if you're trying to put your finger on the main difference between 2004/2016 and 2008, it's not that the Democrats picked an 'electable' candidate, but the former were years where fundamentals favored Republicans and the latter was a year where they strongly favored the Democrats.</div>

			<div class="content">I think an important, though ultimately very thin, part of the &quot;Sanders is electable&quot; argument is &quot;look at Trump!&quot;<br /><br />I have a bad theory about Presidential elections, one that does not really cover 2020. I call it the &quot;novelty&quot; factor. That is, in aPresidential election, ca ndidate who look &quot;different&quot; in some way get a boost. Kennedy over Nixon, (Nixon over Humphrey would I think be a wash) Carter over Ford, Reagan over Carter (Mondale-Reagan would be something of a wash I guess) Clinton over Bush, Clinton over Dole, Bush over Gore, Bush over Kerry, Obama over McCain, Obama over Romney, and of course Trump over Clinton. <br /><br />Elections with an incumbent are different--my &quot;novelty&quot; score may be a factor, but other factors, retrospective voting, are far more important. And of course, to add to the dumbness of my theory, you can certainly argue with my account over which candidate was really more novel  in many of these cases. <br /><br />Also, I really don't know which of Trump or Sanders is more novel.</div>

The Obama x2 / Trump voter as I am. Sanders running on the platform of eliminating private health insurance will continue that trend, especially among union members who certainly won't want to give up their cadillac plans (health care is the one major benefit of unions that is still left). Sanders wanting to ban all fracking also will hurt him in PA. As Andrew Yang said on CNN last week, the blue collar working class voter is basically gone from the Dems at this point. Furthermore, Trump is going to pull a higher percentage of african american vote than any Republican presidential candidate in modern history.....especially if Sanders is the nominee. <br /><br />It's the lifelong Dems that have moved away from the party that will once again decide the election.</div>

			<div class="content">also don't believe the polls when it comes to a general election against trump.  other than faux news and some radio stations, the news, media, and entertainment industry has done a fantastic job going all in anti-trump (granted most of it is well deserved) but they have shamed and ridiculed those who would vote for him or share some of his ideas.  this ridicule may even go to friends, family, workplace or let's say even a message board where they may be called insignificant.  these people have gone underground, there is a significant amount of individuals that will vote for trump who won't admit it to some random pollster anonymously over the phone for fear of embarrassment or backlash. <br /><br />be very cautious of the numbers, because the same confidence that hillary had just minutes before voting began predicting a near landslide, will happen again.  so if the polls say sanders may have a chance against trump, i hate to say it don't believe it.  i wouldn't trust anything unless it was double digits.  <br /><br />even with all that being said... anyone but sanders, does beat trump.  to lose to trump is quite an accomplishment actually.</div>
