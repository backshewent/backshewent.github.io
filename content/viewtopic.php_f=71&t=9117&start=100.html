<br />
<br />My recollection isn't great on it, but I seem to recall the GOP proposal was estimated to cost $400 bil or so over 10 years, and the Dem was like $800, but after the GOP passed it, the estimate was revised upward to $500 bil or so, much to the consternation of the conservatives who were ranting against it.
<br />
<br />As for spending on the elderly, it is pretty annoying, isn't it? If I end up making 40k this year, paying both sides of FICA out of my own pocket is like six grand, which is a lot of money that I wish I could keep for my own damn self. Inter generational compacts can go screw themselves. I know everyone &quot;pays&quot; both sides, but when you actually write the check yourself, it burns more.
<br />
<br />Old folks vote, and are to some extent a swing group depending on who is going to give them more free stuff. I can only hope their latent or open racism and homophobia is enough to overcome their irrational fear that the GOP will take away their social security checks in 2010 and 2012.</div>

<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If one were to analyze matters from a purely utilitarian perspective, one could find ways to justify the White House's attempt to write a health care plan that accommodates the desires of the pharmaceutical and drug industries [mandates (i.e., 50 million forced new customers) plus government subsidies to pay their premiums plus no meaningful cost controls (i.e., no public option)].  All other things being equal, it's better -- from the White House's political perspective -- that those industries not spend vast sums of money trying to defeat Obama's health care proposal, that they not pour their resources into the GOP's 2010 midterm effort, that they not unleash their fully army of lobbyists and strategists to sabotage the Democratic Party.  That's the same calculating mindset that leads the White House to loyally serve the interests of the banking industry that caused the financial crisis (<span style="font-style: italic">we don't want to make enemies out of of Goldman Sachs or turn investment bankers into GOP funders</span>).  Indeed, that's the same mindset that leads the White House to avoid any fights with the Right -- and/or with the intelligence community and permanent military establishment -- over Terrorism policies (<span style="font-style: italic">there's no political benefit to subjecting ourselves to accusations of being Soft on Terror and there's plenty of reasons to cling to those executive powers of secrecy, detention and war-making</span>).<br /><br />In essence, this is the mindset of Rahm Emanuel, and its precepts are as toxic as they are familiar:  The only calculation that matters is maximizing political power.  The only &quot;change&quot; that's meaningful is converting more Republican seats into Democratic ones.  A legislative &quot;win&quot; is determined by whether Democrats can claim victory, not by whether anything constructive was achieved.  The smart approach is to serve and thus curry favor with the most powerful corporate factions, not change the rules to make them less powerful.  The primary tactic of Democrats should be to be more indispensable to corporate interests so as to deny the GOP that money and instead direct it to Democrats.  The overriding strategy is to scorn progressives while keeping them in their place and then expand the party by making it more conservative and more reliant on Blue Dogs.  Democrats should replicate Republican policies on Terrorism and national security -- not abandon them -- in order to remove that issue as a political weapon.<br />...<br />But that isn't what Obama pledged he would do when he campaigned.  He repeatedly vowed he would do the opposite -- that he would reject that thinking and battle aggressively against domination by what he called &quot;the interests of powerful lobbyists or the wealthiest few&quot; who have &quot;run Washington far too long&quot; --  and he convinced millions of people that he was serious, people who, as a result, became fervent devotees to his cause.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />One can argue with this or that specific point in this analysis, as in the other ones, but for myself I can't deny that the most dispiriting thing about the administration through its first seven months has been that after running on &quot;change,&quot; it's been about as strongly Beltway Establishment in staffing, approach and tactics as one could imagine.</div>

All other things being equal, it's better -- from the White House's political perspective -- that those industries not spend vast sums of money trying to defeat Obama's health care proposal, that they not pour their resources into the GOP's 2010 midterm effort, that they not unleash their fully army of lobbyists and strategists to sabotage the Democratic Party.  That's the same calculating mindset that leads the White House to loyally serve the interests of the banking industry that caused the financial crisis (<span style="font-style: italic">we don't want to make enemies out of of Goldman Sachs or turn investment bankers into GOP funders</span>).  Indeed, that's the same mindset that leads the White House to avoid any fights with the Right -- and/or with the intelligence community and permanent military establishment -- over Terrorism policies (<span style="font-style: italic">there's no political benefit to subjecting ourselves to accusations of being Soft on Terror and there's plenty of reasons to cling to those executive powers of secrecy, detention and war-making</span>).<br /><br />In essence, this is the mindset of Rahm Emanuel, and its precepts are as toxic as they are familiar:  The only calculation that matters is maximizing political power.  The only &quot;change&quot; that's meaningful is converting more Republican seats into Democratic ones.  A legislative &quot;win&quot; is determined by whether Democrats can claim victory, not by whether anything constructive was achieved.  The smart approach is to serve and thus curry favor with the most powerful corporate factions, not change the rules to make them less powerful.  The primary tactic of Democrats should be to be more indispensable to corporate interests so as to deny the GOP that money and instead direct it to Democrats.  The overriding strategy is to scorn progressives while keeping them in their place and then expand the party by making it more conservative and more reliant on Blue Dogs.  Democrats should replicate Republican policies on Terrorism and national security -- not abandon them -- in order to remove that issue as a political weapon.<br />...<br />But that isn't what Obama pledged he would do when he campaigned.  He repeatedly vowed he would do the opposite -- that he would reject that thinking and battle aggressively against domination by what he called &quot;the interests of powerful lobbyists or the wealthiest few&quot; who have &quot;run Washington far too long&quot; --  and he convinced millions of people that he was serious, people who, as a result, became fervent devotees to his cause.</div></blockquote><br /><br />One can argue with this or that specific point in this analysis, as in the other ones, but for myself I can't deny that the most dispiriting thing about the administration through its first seven months has been that after running on &quot;change,&quot; it's been about as strongly Beltway Establishment in staffing, approach and tactics as one could imagine.</div></blockquote>
<br />Krugman often doesn't seem to live in the real world, where you have to play the hand you're dealt, work with the other players you find on your team when you join it, recognize that 50% improvement is far better than holding out for 99% and getting zilch, and where most people are uncomfortable with too much change too fast.  
<br />
<br />I still see the current woes of the administration having more to do with Dems in Congress, unrealistic advocates like Krugman, and starting in a deep hole.  Yes, the financial bailout certainly could have been conducted a heck of a lot better.  But TARP was conceived and its major implementation decisions made by Paulson/Bush and passed by the Congressional Dems, without the controls or increased financial regulation that many of these same Congressional Dems now say are needed.  The initial big payments to the financial industry were made without restrictions on bonuses, or requirements on better actions with defaulting homeowners, or any explicit requirement to actually lend out the money they were given.  Once the initial $ went out to AIG, you were stuck with them or confronted with losing a truly big pile of taxpayer $.
<br />
<br />On healthcare, it has been clear since day one that the huge reforms that Krugman wants had no chance of passage.  Does he want to make as much of an improvement in healthcare and covering the uninsured as is politically feasible in one bite or does he want no change, but no wavering from mouthing the nirvana formula he supports.  Ditto on stimulus.  The administration probably got as big a package through Congress as was politically possible.  Krugman thinks it was too small.  That's nice, but pushing for his plan would have cost time, further delaying the stimulus, and ultimately either been scaled back or defeated.
<br />
<br />Krugman and other progressives in and out of Congress are upset that the Bush tax cuts will be allowed to expire, rather than being repealed and that the Bush administration isn't being investigated for war crimes.  This would be the same Dem Congress that actually passed the Bush tax cuts, went along with the Iraq war declaration, failed to object after CIA torture briefings, went along with the NSA information gathering excesses and the renditions/detentions.  Social Security privatization seems the only significant Bush proposal that they stood up against.</div>

If he just ran things the way the religious right wanted them, wouldn't we be WORSE off (of course it's arguable he DID run things that way, but I'm using your terms and worldview).</div></blockquote><br /><br />One could argue that's exactly what Medicare Part D was (though that particular one was much more Rove than DeLay). It was a &quot;Democratic purpose&quot;--expanding prescription drug coverage for the elderly--done with the goals of 1) pulling seniors toward the Republicans 2) protecting pharma profits by banning the government from negotiating 3) keeping pharma campaign money from going to the Dems who might otherwise push this issue. </div></blockquote><br /><br />I think you're mostly right on this, and it's a good example, but I would add a 4) Pass a less expansive version of the program that costs 40% less than the version the Democrats were proposing and hope that's enough to stop the seniors for begging for more free $#@! for a decade or two.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't remember the specifics of the Dem proposal, though I think you might be referring to the &quot;doughnut&quot; nature of the coverage under what was passed, annual prescription costs between about $2000 and $6000 that the government didn't cover. (My recollection is that seniors could buy supplemental coverage for that.) Of course, if they'd let the feds negotiate prices, it stands to reason that major savings could have accrued. <br /><br />Stepping back from that, though, you've put your finger on something really interesting: how far are we as a society going to go in subsidizing the elderly at the expense of the rest of us? And how will the politics of that play out? <br /><br />The traditional orientation of older voters toward the Democrats might be reversing itself, given that they don't like Obama, The Gays or most disruptions to a status quo that's pretty kind to them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />My recollection isn't great on it, but I seem to recall the GOP proposal was estimated to cost $400 bil or so over 10 years, and the Dem was like $800, but after the GOP passed it, the estimate was revised upward to $500 bil or so, much to the consternation of the conservatives who were ranting against it.<br /><br />As for spending on the elderly, it is pretty annoying, isn't it? If I end up making 40k this year, paying both sides of FICA out of my own pocket is like six grand, which is a lot of money that I wish I could keep for my own damn self. Inter generational compacts can go screw themselves. I know everyone &quot;pays&quot; both sides, but when you actually write the check yourself, it burns more.<br /><br />Old folks vote, and are to some extent a swing group depending on who is going to give them more free stuff. I can only hope their latent or open racism and homophobia is enough to overcome their irrational fear that the GOP will take away their social security checks in 2010 and 2012.</div></blockquote>
<br />Social Security and Medicare have greatly reduced poverty among the elderly and they are now the age group with the lowest poverty problem, the least problems with medical coverage, and the group least impcted by the deep recession.  They are probably also the only group that could be lacking prescription drug coverage, given a federal program at highly subsidized rates, and complain vehemently that the plan only covers 75% of their expenses.  They will then complain that if only the bill had been enacted differently with the drug companies being frontally challenged, then for the same federal $, their drugs could be completely free.  Of course, such a bill would have been politically impossible to pass.  A lot of folks in Congress took heat for this bill and committed half a trillion $ to augment a Medicare program that was already struggling fiscally, a risky vote taken to help seniors, and the response from seniors is -- you screwed us to protect the pharma companies.  Fine, if it's such a bad bill, ask Congress to rescind the benefit as part of the payment for covering the younger completely uninsured Americans, and buy your own prescription drugs.
<br />
<br />At the present time, the poorest demographic age group in America is the young adults, especially the young parents.</div>

<br />
<br />No, Beck has a lot more in common with Abbie Hoffman than Edmund Burke. Also, it seems, these days, the right is far more interested in Gramsci and Derrida than the left, at least as architects of political strategy.</div>
