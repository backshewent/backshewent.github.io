			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>B) Whether or not we make implicit appeals to racism, will that make Obama any more or less black?</div></blockquote><br />Otherwise, it seems like you're saying that people are explicitly or implicitly racist, so it's only sound tactics for the Republicans to play that up. (&quot;After all, he *is* black, and it helps us win, and we like to win.&quot;) <br /><br />I hope that isn't the case, and that you're not implying all the ugly things one could see in what you wrote here.</div></blockquote><br />I was just saying that some people are racist and won't vote for a black guy. It's not a huge chunk of people, thankfully, but it's real.<br /><br />Unlike the Mormon thing or something that the ignorant can't tell at first glance this particular bit of bigotry doesn't really need to be exploited or played up. Since they'll probably be able to figure it out all on their own.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The key here is how many of the people who won't for a black man would vote Democratic anyway? How many Kerry voters does Obama lose if he's the nominee? I won't say that number is 0, but I don't think it's all that large. 
<br />
<br />I also think the Romney Mormon thing is overblown, in part because I suspect that a good proportion of the people who said they won't vote for a Mormon are liberals who are turned off by that denomination's conservatism and longstanding association with the Republican party. 
<br />
<br />McCain and evangelicals however is a different kettle of fish altogether. Huckabee might play nice and bring some of them back in. But McCain's people need to be very careful how they treat him. He's notoriously thin skinned, and he holds a grudge. He barely lifted a finger to help Hutchison out in the gubernatorial election here two years ago, and many believe that he might have voted for Beebe, thanks to a long standing feud in the AR Republican party. A Huckabee who perceives a slight could be very, very bad for Republicans. 
<br />
<br />Some evangelicals (maybe enough in a swing state like Missouri) will stay home, and a few may find Obama's rhetoric and optimism appealing and cast a vote for him.
<br />
<br />You can say that won't matter, Obama's a liberal. But among unsophisticated voters, style and tone matters a lot. I don't think Reagan Democrats voted for supply side economics in 1980. They voted for optimism. Issues weren't the central issue in 1980, and I don't think they're going to matter so much in 2008 either.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>There's definitely a yawning racial gap there. I'm not calling people racist any more than I'm calling women who vote for Hillary sexist. It's just the way things go. I'd vote for someone from New Jersey. Am I Jerseyist? I dunno, I think it's sort of natural to support someone who is like yourself, especially if you're from a disrespected group.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />That's all fine (and I'm amused by the idea of New Jerseyans as a detested minority--it's true enough here in NYC, yet some of my best friends, etc), but I read your original post less as &quot;African-Americans and women are sticking up for their own&quot; than as &quot;whites won't vote for Obama, as Louisiana shows, and your silly caucuses don't change that.&quot; 
<br />
<br />But you granted the point about DE, MO, CT, so let's put it aside. I don't think you're defending racism, and hopefully you at least see something wrong with the Republicans' &quot;southern strategy&quot; type tactics--as Ken Mehlman seemed to in recent years. 
<br />
<br />The Dean quote, by the way, isn't supportive of your point--though it's easily enough taken out of context. The context was that the &quot;bubba&quot; voters had been manipulated by &quot;God, guns and gays&quot; away from voting their economic self-interest, and Dean wanted to appeal directly to them with an argument that boiled down to &quot;we disagree on some things, but we're together on what's important.&quot; 
<br />
<br />This was (characteristically) arrogant and possibly wrong on the facts--there's a whole theory that we're into a post-material electorate where values actually do matter as much or more than pocketbook issues--but it wasn't an appeal to those Confederate flags.</div>

<br />
<br />I still have trouble seeing how he justifies endorsing Clinton, but the lack of mandates in Obama's health care plan is apparently a big hurdle and he seems to doubt whether Obama is &quot;tough enough to fight the special interests.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Frankly I think Edwards should just stay on the sidelines with Gore, but if he endorses Obama I'm sure that would be helpful.</div>

<br />Some evangelicals feel LDS is pretty much a cult that pretends to be Christian but really isn't. LDS doesn't have a lot of the things they consider essential to Christianity. Book of Mormon? Add to that the history of polygamy, the missions, the church's secretiveness and wealth, the heavy concentration of Mormons in one area far away, and tithing and you have quite a bit of fear and misunderstanding. Protestants used to be very concerned that Catholics followed the Pope over their own country and they aren't sure what the Mormons follow.

<br />Romney had a lot to overcome. His father's 1968 campaign wasn't able to.</div>

<br />This is going from memory, and I can't figure out how to find the damn archived elections on LA's SoS website. They stop before this for some reason.

<br />Anyway, I recall Terrell running way ahead of Jindal when you lined up their numbers in the northern part of the state and Jindal cleaning up in metro New Orleans. Obviously there were a lot of other factors going into that, but I'm comfortable making the unfounded assertion that racism played a significant, and probably decisive role, when you look at the 2002 and 2003 numbers next to each other.
<br />
<br />Edit: And going back to one of your earlier comments on what Obama might lose compared to Kerry...I guess the slippage is probably worse for GOPers when we run minorities because more often than not these voters who make such decisions to vote like that are more often than not going to vote for the Republican.

<br />
<br />Race is of course factor in LA politics, but it isn't the only factor. The gulf between N. and S. is big too. Name matters a lot, and remember, Terrell may have run better than Jindal, but both lost. Yes, Jindal did not carry some key Republican districts, and his ethnicity didn't help. But neither did his Rhodes Scholarship, nor his Catholicism, nor the fact that he was from Baton Rouge. 
<br />
<br />To me, the problem in 2003 was that he wasn't a good ol' boy. In 2007, many Louisianans realized good ol' boys (or girls) didn't make good governors.</div>

<br />
<br />They'll say it's an outcome of the caucus system. This is valid, if for no other reason that the Obama people tend to organize their asses off, which matters in caucuses. 
<br />
<br />But the narrative will be bad for them anyway. <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/clinton-campaign-manager-is-out/?hp" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Clinton bounced her campaign manager today</a>; my understanding is that thriving campaigns don't tend to do that. 
<br />
<br />Obama's way ahead in the Tuesday contests too. There's probably some risk of Clinton, looking to contests a month from now, falling into the same trap Giuliani did when he waited for the Florida primary to save him.</div>

<br />As previously noted, Douthat's my favorite conservative pundit both because he's super-smart, and (more) because it's just such a good name for a principled conservative.

<br />Do That is a good name for a conservative too. Telling the rest of us slobs how to live our lives and all that.

<br />Frankly, I think we're seeing a meltdown that might be as profound as '68 in Chicago.

They stop before this for some reason.<br /><br />Anyway, I recall Terrell running way ahead of Jindal when you lined up their numbers in the northern part of the state and Jindal cleaning up in metro New Orleans. Obviously there were a lot of other factors going into that, but I'm comfortable making the unfounded assertion that racism played a significant, and probably decisive role, when you look at the 2002 and 2003 numbers next to each other.<br /><br />Edit: And going back to one of your earlier comments on what Obama might lose compared to Kerry...I guess the slippage is probably worse for GOPers when we run minorities because more often than not these voters who make such decisions to vote like that are more often than not going to vote for the Republican.<br /><br />Edit part 2:<br /><br /><a href="http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcmp&rqsdta=12070214012601" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2002 Terrell Landrieu</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcmp&rqsdta=11150310012919" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2003 Jindal Blanco</a><br /><br />Check out like Ouachita...Yeah, I'm just making this up, but I think there's something to it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Race is of course factor in LA politics, but it isn't the only factor. The gulf between N. and S. is big too. Name matters a lot, and remember, Terrell may have run better than Jindal, but both lost. Yes, Jindal did not carry some key Republican districts, and his ethnicity didn't help. But neither did his Rhodes Scholarship, nor his Catholicism, nor the fact that he was from Baton Rouge. <br /><br />To me, the problem in 2003 was that he wasn't a good ol' boy. In 2007, many Louisianans realized good ol' boys (or girls) didn't make good governors.</div></blockquote>
<br />My point is that both lost 52-48% statewide, but Jindal did much better in the New Orleans metro area, Baton Rouge and Shreveport, while Terrell did a lot better in the rest of the northern part of the state, and Cajun country (of course that's where Blanco is from, so that's more understandable). I guess just when I look at the counties along the Mississippi in the northern half of the state, I like blaming ignorance, because it's more fun than thinking people rejected conservatism.</div>

Obviously there were a lot of other factors going into that, but I'm comfortable making the unfounded assertion that racism played a significant, and probably decisive role, when you look at the 2002 and 2003 numbers next to each other.<br /><br />Edit: And going back to one of your earlier comments on what Obama might lose compared to Kerry...I guess the slippage is probably worse for GOPers when we run minorities because more often than not these voters who make such decisions to vote like that are more often than not going to vote for the Republican.<br /><br />Edit part 2:<br /><br /><a href="http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcmp&rqsdta=12070214012601" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2002 Terrell Landrieu</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcmp&rqsdta=11150310012919" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">2003 Jindal Blanco</a><br /><br />Check out like Ouachita...Yeah, I'm just making this up, but I think there's something to it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Race is of course factor in LA politics, but it isn't the only factor. The gulf between N. and S. is big too. Name matters a lot, and remember, Terrell may have run better than Jindal, but both lost. Yes, Jindal did not carry some key Republican districts, and his ethnicity didn't help. But neither did his Rhodes Scholarship, nor his Catholicism, nor the fact that he was from Baton Rouge. <br /><br />To me, the problem in 2003 was that he wasn't a good ol' boy. In 2007, many Louisianans realized good ol' boys (or girls) didn't make good governors.</div></blockquote><br />My point is that both lost 52-48% statewide, but Jindal did much better in the New Orleans metro area, Baton Rouge and Shreveport, while Terrell did a lot better in the rest of the northern part of the state, and Cajun country (of course that's where Blanco is from, so that's more understandable). I guess just when I look at the counties along the Mississippi in the northern half of the state, I like blaming ignorance, because it's more fun than thinking people rejected conservatism.</div></blockquote>

<br />I don't know about the demographic specifics, but in AR and MS those counties tend to be overwhelming Democratic. They're extremely poor and black.

<br />
<br />It doesn't seem as signficant in LA as it does in AR or MS.
<br />
<br />I know in 2003 the Republican strongholds in N. LA didn't go for Jindal. 
<br />
<br />Also, ideological divides in state politics, especially in LA and AR tend to be very, very narrow. Personality counts for a lot more than issue positions, since everyone more or less holds the same positions here.</div>
