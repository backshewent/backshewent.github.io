			<div class="content">Also, even if the polls show a close race, I'd still give Christie +5 over the last poll results. I think Corzine tends to over expose himself in the waning weeks of a campaign, and there will be a significant backlash from that. The problem of course is that the Corzine backlash may end up helping Daggett more than Christie.</div>

			<div class="content">It's not the NJ GOP's fault that this entire region of the country has stopped electing Republicans. New Jersey compares pretty favorably to a lot of neighboring states with GOP success. We still have 5/13 congressional seats, 43% of the state senate. We're going to pick up assembly seats next Tuesday. 
<br />
<br />Look at New York, we're about to be down to 2! congressional seats in the whole delegation. Out of 29. There isn't a single Republican representative left in New England. Eastern PA, Gerlach is giving up his seat and Charlie Dent is getting a real race this cycle in a bad district for us. I guess we might pick up Sestak's seat, but there's a real chance Joe Pitts is the only Republican Rep in the 11 PA districts in the Eastern half of the state after 2010.</div>

<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Republican Party's favorable rating among Americans is at lowest level in at least a decade, according to a new national poll.<br />Thirty-six percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday say they have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party, with 54 percent viewing the GOP negatively.<br /><br />According to the poll, 53 percent have a positive opinion of the Democratic Party, with 41 percent holding an unfavorable view. The survey indicates that favorable ratings for the Democrats have dropped 5 points since February, with the Republican number slipping 3 points.</div></blockquote>
<br />pretty rough go of it out there for Republicans just generally in the US, let alone the Northeast.  The Northeast is dead for Republicans, though, for at least a couple cycles.  Still, get a couple appealing moderates in there running and things could change?  The national party would have to relent on some things, I would imagine.
<br />
<br />
<br />As far as the GOP in PA, PItts is in Lancaster, which is still a GOP stronghold.  Outside of that, yeah, things look pretty bleak in the southeast looking forward, let alone all of eastern PA. Who is running for Gerlach's seat? I don't even know.
<br />
<br />
<br />edit: I went on Pitts' website, and was interested to see what his issues were:
<br />Budget and Spending
<br />Conservation and Agriculture
<br />Defense
<br />Education
<br />Energy and Environment
<br />Foreign Affairs 
<br />Health Care 
<br />Human Rights
<br />Jobs and Employment
<br />Life and Bioethics
<br />Tax Relief
<br />Transportation
<br />Veterans Issues
<br />
<br />Really, that's the sweet spot there for Republicans nowadays, right?  Focusing on social issues was all about creating wedges and nothing about accomplishing any goals or passing any real legislation on a national level, but the above are things they can talk about, try and do, and then say back 'hey look at what we did OVA HERE!'.</div>

			<div class="content">I just find it kind of rich that the Republican purists venerate Reagan and charge that they've lost recently in part because the party has strayed from Reagan's message, but Reagan himself was both the ultimate big-tent guy (&quot;the 11th Commandment&quot;) and a willing, sometimes eager participant in bipartisan compromises, including all the budget deals that included tax increases, that no Republican could make today without coming in for relentless attack. By current standards, he would have been the biggest RINO of all.
<br />
<br />The conclusion I'm left with is that Reagan's success stemmed primarily from the fact that he was likable, not that he was this forthright super-conservative. (I seem to remember that poll after poll found a big gap between approval of Reagan the individual and agreement with his political philosophy--something Obama has going for him, to a lesser extent and at least for the time being.) After reading the Reeves and Wilentz books, I can buy that he had basic conservative notions in which he truly believed and that he'd worked out over many, many years in public life, but they were guiding principles, not dogma. I wonder if someone like Reagan--whose primary political virtues were optimism and coming across as relatable--could even rise in the Republican Party as it exists right now.</div>

			<div class="content">Reagan did run a hard fought primary campaign against a sitting Republican president. He was for a big tent, but he was for improving the party from within as well. He just emphasized the time to do that was during primaries. The NY-23 race is unique because there wasn't a primary. A few folks sitting around a table picked the GOP nominee, and it's a person who it turns out is out of step with the GOP base on tons of issues. It goes beyond the abortion and gay marriage stuff. She favors card check (her husband is a union boss), she supported Obama's stimulus package, has said she might vote for the Dem health care bill. There are more areas of disagreement than agreement with the average GOP voter. There's a candidate in the race who is better funded than she is, has a realistic shot at winning, agrees with the GOP base on most issues, and would be winning the race if he had an R after his name.</div>

<br />I'm not at all saying it wasn't real--I'm saying it wasn't the selling point. Reagan didn't win because of his conservatism; conservatism won because it had an extremely effective champion/front man in Reagan. My original point was that his supposedly most devoted followers now don't seem to understand why he succeeded.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I'm pretty sure the Great Society/War on Poverty stuff was done away with under Nixon/Ford, or at least neutered (Rumsfeld and Cheney began under Nixon in the Office of Economic Opportunity, and killed it from within). Of course, Reagan helped do away with the public's support or even tolerance for activist government, to the point where no subsequent Democratic candidate has ever explicitly campaigned to bring such things back again. 
<br />
<br />jh, I should have been clear that I wasn't referring to the New York race in particular--it was more like a political thread random thought. (Though my sense is that the opposition to the Republican nominee in that race has to do more with her relatively liberal positions than the fact that her position was conferred by appointment. To take a semi-similar case, I dislike Kirsten Gillibrand largely because I don't like the way she got her job, but the fact that she's basically Schumer's little shadow, and I agree with Schumer on almost everything not touching upon his Wall Street whoredom, renders me likely to vote unenthusiastically for Gillibrand even though she doesn't &quot;impress&quot; me at all.)</div>

<br />The Dem party just about died in the last years of LBJ.  The Civil Rights Act, which was a correct and courageous thing to do, stripped away most of the south, while escalating the war and the Chicago convention stripped away all but the old left and labor.  Doomed Humphrey and later gave the party to McGovern.  Carter was pretty much a fluke reaction to the Watergate scandal.  LBJ pretty much solely ushered in a prolonged period of Republican dominance and Dem confusion.  It just coincidentally happened that the Republicans had a lot of pent up conservative theory and intellectual energy ready to unleash.  Without LBJ that would have stayed bottled up in the think tanks for another generation.</div>

<br />I was confident 30+ years ago that some sort of legalization would take place in my lifetime, but did not at all imagine it would come in such ungainly form.

<br />
<br />I don't know about New Hampshire, but I think there's a misconception about how much marijuana enforcement really costs a state. First of all, for simple possession, in Arkansas, you're unlikely to do any time. So, there's really not much of a jail cost. Other costs are hidden in the day to day business of law enforcement. That is, legalizing marijuana (unless you then tax it) won't save states much if any money. But starting up an entire program from scratch that isn't about law enforcement is an entirely different matter. Unless the FDA goes ahead and makes it available through a prescription like any other medication, states are likely to have trouble setting up a system to deal with this.</div>
