<br />I'm with you that Brooks has found an appropriate ballpark. My discomfort is that he comes at it wielding the intellectual/rhetorical equivalents of a hockey stick & a hula hoop.
<br />
<br />That is, he literally believes skill levels are the issue, rather than the &quot;ownership&quot; broadening (redistribution for you, joiseyhoya - I ain't afraid of them pinko commie-type terms) they can (but are by no means guaranteed to) produce.
<br />
<br />More years of school or training have no straight line correlation with &quot;true&quot; increases in skills. I'll concede they may correlate nicely with endless volumes of &quot;bowling trophy&quot;-quality credentialling, which of course is not the same thing at all. 
<br />
<br />Moreover, do I really need better plumbers, electricians, or respiratory therapists if we're all better off with structural changes that allow us essentially to 'pretend'  more of us are doing useful &quot;skillsy&quot; work, while enjoying the output of a system that is actually more productive?

To me, the distinction is between high school completion or less and post-secondary certificate or more, with trades apprenticeship most definitely in the second bucket. I know plenty of advanced degree holders who make a lot less than plumbers; that they have some theoretical class advantage, grounded in dubious 19th century values. probably gives them less comfort than the great vacation to which the plumber can treat himself, his wife and kids. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>If I'm king I want FEWER people with their hands on the controls, and am prepared to trade off considerably more bread, chocolates & circuses if everyone (or a lot more people, particularly those who just do not have requisite abilities, or the energy to apply them) just get out of the way, and act more like <span style="font-style: italic">owners</span> (the &quot;real&quot; american dream) than operators.<br /><br />It worked for TR away back at the turn of the 20th century - he was good with reduced work hours as a way to give more people more 'engagement' (can just picture how he'd spit out that horribly maltreated word).</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The big trend in our labor market, given the disappearance of the industrial economy and the decline of unions, is that credentials determine  compensation. This might or might not be justified--for myself, I know I make more money than plenty of people who work harder, in terms of physical exertion or hours spent on the clock--but it does seem to correlate with economic standing and some measure of output. I'd be happy enough if we could just level the starting line and do more to help people finish (by which, again, I mean any kind of post-secondary credential).</div>

Historically, have 2 Senators ever won the White House?<br /><br />There are many more factors than just playing to your strength rather than trying to cover a weakness.</div></blockquote><br />AHHHHH OVERLOAD<br /><br />BTW, there would be one full white guy on the ticket if Obama and Richardson were to be it. They'd have all their bases covered, and it certainly matters the ethnicity of the candidate.  I factor that into my decision when I vote.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<br />I don't know what you beef is?
<br />
<br />Are you saying that no portion of the voting populace will care about Black, Latino and Female? That it's ludicrous to discuss a running mate in those terms? There's no way around the hype of the &quot;first Black president&quot; and it might be a positive or a negative to add the first &quot;female Vice President&quot; etc... that's all I'm saying. There are a variety of factors. He could also go for someone older kind of a Cheney to Bush factor. Didn't Dukakis have an older guy, the whole &quot;you're no John Kennedy&quot; to Quayle thing...?
<br />
<br />I have no problem with Biden, he can do the job and play the part. I don't know that he adds a lot of voters for Obama. NM was a swing state and in the SW the Latino vote is substantial. Richardson could be helpful.
<br />
<br />All I'm saying is that playing to your strength or trying to cover a gap -- isn't the only basis to decide the best running mate.</div>

<br />
<br />We can't solve common sense problems not because of academic obfuscation, but because of class interests. Because a lot of common sense competes with the bottom line. It's common sense to not let corporations pollute, but then they'd have to shut down. And what is common sense to me, may not be to you. When people think their interpretation of the Bible is unfallable and trumps anything else, then we ahve competing views and conflict.
<br />
<br />I live in a neghborhood that has a lot of cafes, bars, bistros... and a big park. I've lived here long enough to see some things change -- we have several big music events in the park now. To some, it's a horror, to others its a great celebration. To some it's common sense to keep our 'hood nice for those who live here and not wreck the park and sell beer to knuckleheads who converge. To others, it's common sense to use the park and have music and festivity and boost business for the small businesses in the 'hood.
<br />
<br />You can never get a consensus on what constitutes &quot;common sense&quot;.</div>

As our President once said, it &quot;makes the pie higher.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'm not so concerned with &quot;neutrality&quot; as &quot;reality&quot;, a meaningful distinction as you've indicated in a later portion of your reply.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>To me, the distinction is between high school completion or less and post-secondary certificate or more, with trades apprenticeship most definitely in the second bucket. I know plenty of advanced degree holders who make a lot less than plumbers; that they have some theoretical class advantage, grounded in dubious 19th century values. probably gives them less comfort than the great vacation to which the plumber can treat himself, his wife and kids. </div></blockquote><br /><br />I agree with you here. I think.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>The big trend in our labor market, given the disappearance of the industrial economy and the decline of unions, is that credentials determine  compensation. This might or might not be justified....</div></blockquote><br /><br />But isn't this Brooks' confusion? He appears to contend that if we can run more people through credentialling mills we'll enjoy an exhilarating, and REAL, productivity updraft.<br /><br />Count me as skeptical. I'm more inclined to see it as reinforcing spurious, divisive, non-productive, marginal &quot;class&quot; distinctions, and increasing the level of confusion about what constitutes productivity. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Philly the Kid wrote:</cite>You can never get a consensus on what constitutes &quot;common sense&quot;.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I'm not a Marxist (jhoya - really!!), but it's hard to get common when distribution of economic clout is uncommon - Pareto optimal, you might say. 
<br />
<br />One person, one vote is a handy, but not especially hefty, counterweight, as political issues are of less pressing concern when one's belly is full, one's tivo operational, and one's cellphone is soon to be a coveted (today, old news tomorrow) smartphone.
<br />
<br />Sure, let's let people earn in to some more balanced level of economic equity. Make it easier for everyone to up their skills -because skills is what makes Bill Gates Bill Gates, right? :goddammitwherestherolleyesemoticonanymore:
<br />
<br />The <span style="font-style: italic">concept</span> makes sense - if not 'common' sense - but it's frankly of diminishing relevance in a world where skills are treated dismissively, discounted heavily, in favor of obeisance to 'personality' and the power of ownership concepts that have stagnated even as the economic & technological forces that undergird them have mutated dramatically over the past 50-75 years.</div>

Obama has to consider a variety of factors... if he goes with richardson then it's a Black and a Latino, that can work pro it can work con. Same with a woman. Does he want 2 first on his ticket at the same time? On the other hand,<span style="font-weight: bold"> I think a governor and a state like NM can do him some good. </span>Biden feels very forced and un-natural. There was a time when I thought Biden could be very presidential himself, and kind of stood for something. <span style="font-weight: bold">A small unknown state like Delaware isn't going to help </span>Obama very much. Historically, have 2 Senators ever won the White House?<br /><br />There are many more factors than just playing to your strength rather than trying to cover a weakness.</div></blockquote><br />AHHHHH OVERLOAD<br /><br />BTW, there would be one full white guy on the ticket if Obama and Richardson were to be it. They'd have all their bases covered, and it certainly matters the ethnicity of the candidate.  I factor that into my decision when I vote.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I don't know what you beef is?<br /><br />Are you saying that no portion of the voting populace will care about Black, Latino and Female? That it's ludicrous to discuss a running mate in those terms? There's no way around the hype of the &quot;first Black president&quot; and it might be a positive or a negative to add the first &quot;female Vice President&quot; etc... that's all I'm saying. There are a variety of factors. He could also go for someone older kind of a Cheney to Bush factor. Didn't Dukakis have an older guy, the whole &quot;you're no John Kennedy&quot; to Quayle thing...?<br /><br />I have no problem with Biden, he can do the job and play the part. I don't know that he adds a lot of voters for Obama. NM was a swing state and in the SW the Latino vote is substantial. Richardson could be helpful.<br /><br />All I'm saying is that playing to your strength or trying to cover a gap -- isn't the only basis to decide the best running mate.</div></blockquote>
<br />Delaware is bigger than New Mexico, and Biden is certainly more influential than Richardson on a national level.   I'd rather Richardson be helpful because he was, you know, good at his job.  Which he is, but still.  Sheesh!  This whole crap about trying to find the best candidate to try to bring some section of the voting populous to the polls IS ludicrous.  Get a guy(or gal, WHO CARES) that can bring VOTERS to the polls, not black voters or white voters or female voters or gay transexual black hippie voters.
<br />
<br />We are soooo stuck in the 60s and 70s.
<br />
<br />
<br />BTW, the Justice Department was hiring people on the basis of their political leanings, and Monica Goodling (remember her?) purposely prevented a lady from finding employment because she heard rumors she heard rumors hte lady was gay.  This is our civil service...and people still wonder whether unions are necessary.</div>

			<div class="content">You are right, but it's close.  I just found that hilarious...New Mexico is some important state with 1.2 millon people, and Delaware is an impossibly small state with a mere 600K people.  So I flipped the populations in my mind, whatever.
<br />
<br />But, of course that negates everything else I wrote, so you all got me! ptk is right, let's all pick everyone by race and state! I respectfully bow out and let you all go back to talking about how we can get a certain percentage of latinos and Virginians and such.</div>

<br />Honestly I didn't even read the rest. I also didn't read what p-t-k wrote. I'm trying to finish a project so I can leave work in time to be in my seat with a beer in by hand at Nats Park by first pitch.
