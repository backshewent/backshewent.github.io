			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>It's really interesting to me that &quot;austerity&quot; got such a fuller trial in Europe than here, even though the median voter there and state is probably well to the left of the avg American and their organized left is much stronger. I guess it's simply that in a parliamentary system, you can implement your agenda until you're voted out. Here, with a center-left government and a radical right opposition, we've tried a kind of mumblecore Keynesianism, which has worked better if not &quot;well.&quot;</div></blockquote><br />But it's a lot more than just ease of policy implementation by ruling governments. As JFLNYC notes, a lot of the austerity has been driven by demands from Germany (and other European institutions) in exchange for necessary loans. The Germans couldn't justify politically handing out tons of money to countries on the periphery of the Eurozone to bail them out of problems that were partially due to their own irresponsibility without extracting concessions to demonstrate they would be responsible moving forward. <br /><br />There are other factors in play as well. EU member countries need to target a maximum of 3% for their deficit, and with the recession and subsequent slow growth this meant making tough decisions to bring themselves back to that line. For many years Greece cooked their books to make it look like they were in line with requirements when in reality they were amassing debts they couldn't pay back. It's also probably worth pointing out that for as much as austerity has been used as a synonym for spending cuts by the left which has held up the struggles of Europe to warn against cutting spending here, the austerity programs in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have all included tax increases.<br /><br />We've been running 8-10% deficits over the past four years, and if we attempted to cut that by 2/3 to get under their 3% window, I'm sure we'd be growing more slowly or in recession as well. The problem is if we continue to spend four dollars for every three we take in and have an ever growing debt/GDP ratio, at some point our interest rates on Treasury bonds will start rising (especially if the Eurozone countries get their houses in order and their government debt starts look like a safer place to park money than ours does). When interest rates increase, they can start to spiral (which is what really added to the woes of Spain and Italy) because higher rates make it tougher for countries to pay back the loans, increasing the risk of those buying bonds and leading them to require a higher rate of return to cover the increased risk. If and when we find ourselves in a spot like a lot of the European countries, we'll need to make quick, painful choices to stop the bleeding that would lead to a prolonged tough period. Austerity may not have been a good solution for European countries, but they were in a spot where they didn't have any good solutions. We shouldn't be in a huge hurry to cut current spending beyond what we'd trim even if we didn't have a deficit and debt problem, but we do need to start moving closer to balance to make sure we don't end up in the same spot. And if we can cut our outyear liabilities through entitlement reform, that would be the biggest step we can take to prevent ourselves from going down that road.</div>

EU member countries need to target a maximum of 3% for their deficit, and with the recession and subsequent slow growth this meant making tough decisions to bring themselves back to that line. For many years Greece cooked their books to make it look like they were in line with requirements when in reality they were amassing debts they couldn't pay back. It's also probably worth pointing out that for as much as austerity has been used as a synonym for spending cuts by the left which has held up the struggles of Europe to warn against cutting spending here, the austerity programs in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have all included tax increases.<br /><br />We've been running 8-10% deficits over the past four years, and if we attempted to cut that by 2/3 to get under their 3% window, I'm sure we'd be growing more slowly or in recession as well. The problem is if we continue to spend four dollars for every three we take in and have an ever growing debt/GDP ratio, at some point our interest rates on Treasury bonds will start rising (especially if the Eurozone countries get their houses in order and their government debt starts look like a safer place to park money than ours does). When interest rates increase, they can start to spiral (which is what really added to the woes of Spain and Italy) because higher rates make it tougher for countries to pay back the loans, increasing the risk of those buying bonds and leading them to require a higher rate of return to cover the increased risk. If and when we find ourselves in a spot like a lot of the European countries, we'll need to make quick, painful choices to stop the bleeding that would lead to a prolonged tough period. Austerity may not have been a good solution for European countries, but they were in a spot where they didn't have any good solutions. We shouldn't be in a huge hurry to cut current spending beyond what we'd trim even if we didn't have a deficit and debt problem, but we do need to start moving closer to balance to make sure we don't end up in the same spot. And if we can cut our outyear liabilities through entitlement reform, that would be the biggest step we can take to prevent ourselves from going down that road.</div></blockquote><br />I don't think we're that different in thinking. I am for cutting spending, when necessary and when we're able. I don't think that time is until we've gotten out of this global mess, though.  I do think spending in Greece and Spain was at a different level than here, though. I don't think cutting what social safety net programs we have helps things though if they remain in the system of farming out healthcare to private insurance.  Nothing we do will truly reform those until we unwed ourselves from the notion of healthcare as a commodity. We're just cutting programs that help those affected the most by a bad economy.<br /><br />As for Europe, Germany did have it tough. They're the only region that isn't hurting right now, while the rest of the Eurozone bleeds. Lack of jobs is the main culprit, though, in my estimation.  There are literally masses of youths without any jobs after coming out of their schooling.  I'm not sure how that was fixed by anything that's been done by the EU and Merkel.  She has a tough job, and the solutions are above my head, but Krugman did have a good article about how Greek workers do work hard, longer than the rest of Europe, but there are no jobs there. Nothing. It's a desert.</div>

The Repubs complain about the huge deficit over the next ten years, then propose solutions that won't impact those deficits by one penny.  We'll gut Medicare and SS, starting for everyone under 55.  Somehow, they are trying to sell the theory that they are doing this to protect all those poor people under 55.<br /><br />Lots of wailing from the party who told us &quot;Reagan taught us that deficits don't matter.&quot;  Unless the President is a democrat, that is.<br /><br />Austerity has been given a big tryout in Europe and failed.  It also aborted the recovery from our own Great Depression when we tried to tackle the deficit, before the economy was fixed.<br /><br />The art of political masturbation -- compete on the basis of telling Congress's ten years from now what rules the country will live by.  This from the guys who scrapped PAYGO, because it didn't permit the unaffordable tax cuts, wars, and entitlement expansions they wanted.  But that was then, when they were in charge and the economy was good.  Now we need austerity.<br /><br />I'm not worried about the sequester battle.  Just letting the sequester happen might be as good an approach as any.  The 'draconian' cut in military spending is a lot less of a cut in military spending than we actually need.  Homeland Security can spend less on their farcical airport inspections.  The 9/11 problem was solved when we reinforced the cockpit doors.  Yes, you can try to blow up a plane if you're a terrorist, but to what point?  You can kill more people more easily at any number of entertainment venues or on a cruise ship.  We spend $bazillions to deal with the last terrorist strategy.</div>

			<div class="content">chait with a great <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/debt-ceiling-hostage-enablers.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">post</a> on the debt ceiling hostage crisis<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Douthat and McArdle do disavow debt ceiling hostage-taking. But, in pox-on-both-houses, assert that the prospective response of minting platinum coins is just as bad. (McArdle: “Silly loopholes are exploited for bargaining power, and the resulting stalemates are generally solved with a temporary patch that solves the immediate problem by creating a bigger one down the road.” Douthat: “One party behaves irresponsibly, the other side counters with a wave of irresponsibility of its own.”) And so, if Republicans do refuse to raise the debt ceiling, they can assume that the result will not be a wave of abhorrence directed at them but instead a diffuse disgust at Washington in general, perhaps accompanied by more calls for third parties, as happened the last time Republicans flirted with financial disaster in 2011.<br /><br />It’s true that, as a matter of procedure, the platinum coin gambit is just as much of a boundary-pushing exercise as debt ceiling hostage-taking, technically legal but violating the spirit of the law. But one is an exercise in boundary pushing that deliberately creates the risk of economic chaos in order to advance partisan ends. The other gambit is an effort to forestall economic chaos. Surely there are important differences between pushing the legal line to create a weapon and pushing the legal line to defuse one. And yes, both McArdle and Douthat argue that Republicans might retaliate by taking even crazier and more dangerous positions, but that again does not make defensive measures against destructive threats anything like an equivalent to threats themselves.<br /><br />...<br /><br />If the two sides agree the debt ceiling should go up, then having a vote on that one thing is not a condition. Adding policies on which they may disagree is a condition. It turns a question on which the two parties agree (let’s not blow up the world economy) into one on which they disagree (what is the appropriate level of federal spending, and/or how much should Republicans get in return for not blowing up the world economy?).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />and this article about freshman republican house member Tom Cotton is legitimately scary:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I’m not a big fan of the journalism of Politico’s Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen. You could look it up.<br /><br />But now and then, they offer something their fellow Beltway chroniclers of movers-and-shakers ought to take to heart. That is definitely true of their profile of freshman U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) as exemplar of what they call the “hell no caucus” of the House GOP. <br /><br />They explain how Cotton won an open seat in Arkansas in no small part because of a sizable unsolicited Club for Growth contribution that gave him the resources to win one of the many “more-conservative-than-thou” GOP primaries. Thus he owes absolutely nothing to the NRCC or the House leadership. And Cotton does not appear to be a man interested in learning the mores and folkways of Washington, or how to “get things done.”<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In an interview in his still-bare office a few hours before being sworn in, Cotton told us he would have voted against both Speaker John Boehner’s “Plan B” tax on millionaires, and the final tax hike that got the country off the fiscal cliff. He vowed to vote against raising the debt limit in two months, absent the sort of massive cuts the president opposes. He said he is more concerned about the “cataclysmic” consequences of inaction than the “short-term market corrections” of default. “I’d like to take the medicine now,” he said.</div></blockquote><br /><br />If the greater meaning of Cotton’s statement isn’t clear enough, he’s calling a potential return to national and global recession a “short-term market correction,” and “medicine,” the latter reference suggesting that phenomena like millions of people losing their livelihoods is good for the country if it ultimately leads to millions of people losing government benefits. <br /><br />VandeHei and Allen do not mention the controversy Cotton aroused back in 2006 when he was serving as an infantry officer in Iraq. Having read a New York Times article on a covert Bush administration operation to gain access to the financial records of American citizens without warrant or subpoena in an effort to find possible links to terrorist networks, Cotton penned a letter to the Times suggesting that reporters and editors responsible for the story be prosecuted for espionage. <br /><br />This is clearly not a man of nuanced views. But as VandeHei and Allen point out:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>To much of the country, Cotton is nothing more than a straight, Southern, white, male, “radical” conservative — a befuddling relic of a fading slice of politics. But in Washington, he is the Republican Congress. Only through understanding lawmakers like him can you understand why the grand bargain collapsed, why raising the debt limit is not a given and why Boehner has vowed to quit for good his private chats with President Barack Obama, and instead invest more power in the Tom Cottons of the world.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Aside from confusing “much of the country” with “most of the people we talk to,” VandeHei and Allen are spot on here. And they also point out that Cotton is no ignorant yahoo from Dogpatch: he’s a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law school who clerked for a circuit court judge and then volunteered for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining McKinsey & Company. <br /><br />Cotton is emblematic of a brand of movement conservatism that has slowly taken over the Republican Party after decades of struggle; saw its ultimate validation in the 2010 midterm elections; and isn’t about to loosen its grip on its trophy of ideological war. Its shock troops believe in a rigid, permanent model of governance that is impervious not only to Washington power games and deal-making, but to the social and economic consequences of its preferred policies and indeed to all contrary empirical evidence. Most of them believe the destruction of the Welfare State is the only path consistent with patriotism and constitutional government; many (I don’t know enough about Cotton to know if he shares this particular motivation) believe their ideology reflects obedience to the eternal laws of Almighty God. <br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_01/shine_on_brightly042315.php">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/politi ... 042315.php</a><!-- m --><br /><br />then there is also this: <br /><br />Greg Giroux ‏@greggiroux <br />House R freshmen voted 16-19 (46-54%) on 1st Sandy bill.

These have zoomed during a time when work is less physically demanding and people are retiring earlier.  It suggests a lot of scamming going on.  As does the huge geographical imbalance of approved disability claims.  PR and parts of NYC seem to be the disability capitals.  Not saying many of these people don't need help, but payroll taxes aren't the way to fund welfare.   That should be coming from the general fund budget.  And some is just ripoff.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>...The problem is if we continue to spend four dollars for every three we take in and have an ever growing debt/GDP ratio, at some point our interest rates on Treasury bonds will start rising (especially if the Eurozone countries get their houses in order and their government debt starts look like a safer place to park money than ours does). When interest rates increase, they can start to spiral (which is what really added to the woes of Spain and Italy) because higher rates make it tougher for countries to pay back the loans, increasing the risk of those buying bonds and leading them to require a higher rate of return to cover the increased risk. If and when we find ourselves in a spot like a lot of the European countries, we'll need to make quick, painful choices to stop the bleeding that would lead to a prolonged tough period. Austerity may not have been a good solution for European countries, but they were in a spot where they didn't have any good solutions. We shouldn't be in a huge hurry to cut current spending beyond what we'd trim even if we didn't have a deficit and debt problem, but we do need to start moving closer to balance to make sure we don't end up in the same spot.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I haven't checked all that recently, but i believe people making capital allocation decisions around the world are still lining up to loan the US money, at essentially negative rates of 'return'. What did Boehner say about &quot;candy & nuts&quot;?</div>
