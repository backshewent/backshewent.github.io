			<div class="content">The most insightful thing I read about the filibuster rules change--admittedly from folks broadly sympathetic to it--was that the real shift that prompted this change was from its use for blocking relatively extreme judges (Dems during W.) to its use for blocking judges regardless of ideology AND blocking executive branch appointees over the last five years. This in turn was prompted by the increasing polarization in the Senate--fewer Dick Lugars, more Mike Lees--and the rise of partisan media that would &quot;score&quot; electeds not just for their final vote, but for whether they let a nominee get to a final vote. <br /><br />It's really unfortunate that this was necessary. But I do think it was necessary, and I'm pretty certain that McConnell in Reid's position would have done the same thing. <br /><br />As I think I've written here before, IMO Congress keeps ceding its own power, usually to the executive, by virtue of its near total unwillingness or inability to do the stuff it's supposed to do.</div>

Frist should have done it back in 2005. It seems like there's been an ever increasing willingness of the party outside the White House to use more extreme tactics to prevent the president's nominees from getting through. It's all a bit partisan depending on where you sit on who deserves more of the blame, but I'm writing so we'll start it at Bork, which seemed to really ignite the idea that voting someone down for ideological reasons was something the Senate ought to consider. Then it increases under Clinton, with Republicans using their majority on the Judiciary Committee to keep nominees they didn't like from ever seeing the floor. Then another ratchet up under Bush, with Democrats using the filibuster to target more than a few nominees, but usually for specific reasons (too conservative or worse yet, conservative AND appealing/Supreme Court material). Now under Obama another step up, with Republicans filibustering lots of people they seemingly don't even have specific objections to, they just don't want Obama to be able to appoint them.<br /><br />Eventually one side was going to pull the trigger on this. No reason to think Democrats under the next GOP president wouldn't have kept these tactics going, leading a GOP majority of less than 60 to invoke the nuclear option themselves. Might as well be the first ones to get to take advantage of it (and especially important for them to do it now in case the GOP wins the Senate in 2014 and can just vote down whoever with 51 votes). <br /><br />Both sides (outside of Levin and McCain) are total hypocrites on it, which is to be expected in a partisan, process fight.</div>

What's different now?<br /><br />JEFF MERKLEY: Well, let's take 2005. In 2005, a deal was reached by a group of seven Republicans and seven Democrats.<br /><br />The deal was that there would be no change in the rules if the Democrats agreed to only filibuster for rare exceptional circumstances, those being terrible problems with character or experience. This deal was completely honored by the Democrats. In fact, they didn't filibuster a single judge thereafter under the Bush administration.<br /><br />But, immediately upon the Republicans becoming the minority party, they broke the deal, and the statistics I have given you just reflected that.

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>dajafi wrote:</cite>The most insightful thing I read about the filibuster rules change--admittedly from folks broadly sympathetic to it--was that the real shift that prompted this change was from its use for blocking relatively extreme judges (Dems during W.) to its use for blocking judges regardless of ideology AND blocking executive branch appointees over the last five years. This in turn was prompted by the increasing polarization in the Senate--fewer Dick Lugars, more Mike Lees--and the rise of partisan media that would &quot;score&quot; electeds not just for their final vote, but for whether they let a nominee get to a final vote. <br /><br />It's really unfortunate that this was necessary. But I do think it was necessary, and I'm pretty certain that McConnell in Reid's position would have done the same thing. <br /><br />As I think I've written here before, IMO Congress keeps ceding its own power, usually to the executive, by virtue of its near total unwillingness or inability to do the stuff it's supposed to do.</div></blockquote><br />I think it's a good idea for the Democrats. Frist should have done it back in 2005. It seems like there's been an ever increasing willingness of the party outside the White House to use more extreme tactics to prevent the president's nominees from getting through. It's all a bit partisan depending on where you sit on who deserves more of the blame, but I'm writing so we'll start it at Bork, which seemed to really ignite the idea that voting someone down for ideological reasons was something the Senate ought to consider. Then it increases under Clinton, with Republicans using their majority on the Judiciary Committee to keep nominees they didn't like from ever seeing the floor. Then another ratchet up under Bush, with Democrats using the filibuster to target more than a few nominees, but usually for specific reasons (too conservative or worse yet, conservative AND appealing/Supreme Court material). Now under Obama another step up, with Republicans filibustering lots of people they seemingly don't even have specific objections to, they just don't want Obama to be able to appoint them.<br /><br />Eventually one side was going to pull the trigger on this. No reason to think Democrats under the next GOP president wouldn't have kept these tactics going, leading a GOP majority of less than 60 to invoke the nuclear option themselves. Might as well be the first ones to get to take advantage of it (and especially important for them to do it now in case the GOP wins the Senate in 2014 and can just vote down whoever with 51 votes). <br /><br />Both sides (outside of Levin and McCain) are total hypocrites on it, which is to be expected in a partisan, process fight.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You'd have to add Pryor to that list I think, but he's not much of a Senator.</div>

			<div class="content">I think an important but not much asked question here is at what point &quot;advance a partisan policy agenda&quot; became the biggest thing you wanted out of a judicial nominee. <br /><br />What was different about bork was that he so clearly saw that as his mission. Granted that Ike regretted appointing Warren and Brennan, and JFK might have rued putting Whizzer White on the Court, Bush 41 with Souter  etc. But even the likes of Roberts and Kagan, both of whom had held serious political jobs, at least simulated humility and objectivity during the process. When you don't even have that fig leaf with a Bork or Janice Rogers Brown, the incentive to block them goes up sharply.</div>

They don't want Obama to have a free hand in appointing a bunch of liberal justices to the bench. The distinction I was trying to make is the Democrats loudly made specific, issue/ruling level objections for the people they filibustered: &quot;OMG this person is anti-abortion!&quot; &quot;she's pro big business!&quot; etc. Some of judges the GOP have been blocking have gotten that treatment, but for the most part it seems like the Senate GOP has taken a less public approach to the battle, with explanations not getting far beyond 'we don't want Obama packing the courts with liberals.' <br /><br />But I don't really see how anyone can think the recent GOP tactics are a weird outlier in the escalation. From <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270E%2C*P%2C%3B%3C%20P%20%20%0A" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">1967-2002</a>, there had been six filibusters that resulted in blocking a nominee total for judicial nominations. After losing the Senate in 2002, the Democrats successfully filibustered 12 Bush nominees in the 108th Congress. They doubled the number of filibustered judges from the previous 18 Congresses in one two year window, inventing the concept of the widespread usage of the filibuster to block judges the party doesn't like. The GOP got pissed at this and threatened to invoke the nuclear option. A compromise was reached to let some of the blocked judges through during the 109th Congress, and Democrats won the Senate soon after that so didn't need to filibuster Bush nominees to block them any more anyway. After the 2010 elections, the GOP revived the tactic Democrats basically invented eight years earlier and used it a bunch more than they did.</div>

Iran has a long and well-documented history of aiding terrorists, I'm not sure how you can't see them getting a nuke is a bad thing.</div>

			<div class="content">The US and Israel also have a long history of aiding terrorists. Who you see as the terrorists depends what side you're on.<br /><br />Netanyahu has come out with some pretty provocative comments about what he'd like to see done to Iran. Again, put yourself in Iran's shoes and read his comments or look at who we helped into power in the region. We helped Hussein get into power and he was brutal to shiite groups.<br /><br />Just to be clear, I'm not saying I want Iran to have them. And I'm not saying it's a good thing for them to have them -- in fact, I think it's most likely bad. I'm just saying that I think it's their right to have them, just as it is our right or Israel's right. If you were Iran, would you trust Israel not to go nuclear with asswipes like Netanyahu in power or would you want to also have nukes to ensure a balance of power?</div>
