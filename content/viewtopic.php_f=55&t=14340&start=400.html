I would much rather have Lee and Pap's contracts than have to compete for FAs to replace them given the way this off season signings went.  I seriously doubt anyone would have just taken Howard's contract without us giving a lot back. I don't get why Olney is so obsessed with this.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I really haven't read his past articles</span>, I don't think, but is that really what he's saying here? Is he saying we should get our payroll way down or <span style="font-weight: bold">is he saying that maybe we could have gotten a few pieces from the Dodgers</span> and then added some other pieces with the money we saved from Lee/Howard/Papelbon, and that combination may make us better off than we are right now (younger and possibly better in the short term). <span style="font-weight: bold">I think it would have depended on who we got from the Dodgers</span> and who we may have gotten from FA or trades. <br /><br />I keep seeing a false dichotomy here, the idea that the choice was go for it with guys like Young and punchless Revere OR blow it up and not be good for a number of years. I don't think those were the only two options, but maybe I'm getting old and senile.</div></blockquote><br />I really doubt that giving them Lee would be enough to dump Howard's contract (and Papelbon's, since I guess many writers and posters consider him a minus player with his contract) and get major league players/prospects headed to the majors.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Maybe not, I don't know because I didn't talk to the dodgers. But maybe they'd give us a few good prospects that could be used in trade. Or not.<br /><br />I wasn't defending his position, just pointing out that I thought his position was being misrepresented.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Olney makes no mention of any valuable pieces the Phillies would get in return for giving up Lee +.  The articles that you can't remember if you read or not were adamant that the Phillies should have dumped his contract on the Dodgers after they claimed him on waivers (i.e. give him away for free without getting anything back).  Now you are imagining some unstated argument that they should get something back of value for these three players. I don't know why you are imagining a position that he never states and then defending this imaginary position against misrepresentation...but that is what you are doing.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I rarely read any of the philly writers these days. Occasionally I go to a link from here, but not usually. Not surprisingly, since it is rare that I do so, I usually don't recall what writer said what. In fact, I had to go back right now to see who the writer was in this case. I generally think they are worthless to read and treat them as such. If they bother you guys so much, I have no idea why you read them.<br /><br />I just assumed he was including the idea that we would get something in return for our guys, since they are not worthless, even with salary considerations, and that we could use these guys to help trade for someone. Maybe he wasn't. I don't care enough to argue about it. He's a bad sportswriter. Don't read him and save yourself the anguish.</div>

If it comes off as being in a bad mood, that's really not the case.  <br /><br />I do think it's funny, however, that I now have some kind of reputation for being emo, a reputation that I've jokingly embraced as not an insult. I spent years being one the more relentlessly positive posters in terms of our chances for success. But one series of posts seems to have erased all that positive will. It's stupid, really.<br /><br />I don't think RAJ has done a good job this offseason, but I will rally by the time pitchers and catchers report and convince myself that we will make the rest of the NL East our bitchez because that's what I always try to do.</div>

I would much rather have Lee and Pap's contracts than have to compete for FAs to replace them given the way this off season signings went.  I seriously doubt anyone would have just taken Howard's contract without us giving a lot back. I don't get why Olney is so obsessed with this.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I really haven't read his past articles, I don't think, but is that really what he's saying here? Is he saying we should get our payroll way down or is he saying that maybe we could have gotten a few pieces from the Dodgers and then added some other pieces with the money we saved from Lee/Howard/Papelbon, and that combination may make us better off than we are right now (younger and possibly better in the short term). I think it would have depended on who we got from the Dodgers and who we may have gotten from FA or trades. <br /><br />I keep seeing a false dichotomy here, the idea that the choice was go for it with guys like Young and punchless Revere OR blow it up and not be good for a number of years. I don't think those were the only two options, but maybe I'm getting old and senile.</div></blockquote><br />I don't see any combination where trading Lee to shed bad contracts makes us better in the short term.<br /><br />The pieces we would've gotten from the Dodgers certainly wouldn't have made us better in the short term though. Howard has only been a negative value player once, and it was last year coming off a major injury. I'd be shocked if he wasn't better this year, at the very least a positive value player. Let's assume it's the same pieces from the Red Sox trade, since that's the model we're working with. The only guy they got that I could see as someone that would've made the 2013 roster would've been Jerry Sands. De La Rosa and Webster might have been in the 5th starter derby, but even that's a stretch.<br /><br />And then, the only thing we've gained from that trade is payroll flexibility in a free agent market where players were absurdly overvalued, so even if we used that flexibility to sign Greinke, Hamilton, and Napoli to fill those holes and gain back that short term value, any short term gain is negated by the fact that we're in the exact same position we started in, except now for a longer period of time, with no marginal benefit at all.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />well. like I said, I wasn't supporting his theory, merely stating that I don't think his position was being fairly represented.</div></blockquote><br />I don't mean for this to sound as dickish as it will, but since you didn't read it, that's where you were wrong. It was fairly represented, and it was being mocked because it's a stupid theory.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>JFLNYC wrote:</cite>Looks like Santa put coal in somebody's stocking.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Nah, I'm just trying to be matter of fact and non-emotional. If it comes off as being in a bad mood, that's really not the case.  <br /><br />I do think it's funny, however, that I now have some kind of reputation for being emo, a reputation that I've jokingly embraced as not an insult. I spent years being one the more relentlessly positive posters in terms of our chances for success. But one series of posts seems to have erased all that positive will. It's stupid, really.<br /><br />I don't think RAJ has done a good job this offseason, but I will rally by the time pitchers and catchers report and convince myself that we will make the rest of the NL East our bitchez because that's what I always try to do.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You have been fairly consistent in your hatred of Amaro from the beginning.  I don't think anything you have written lately is inconsistent with things you have written in the past. Sure you say positive things but you also make a lot of over the top negative posts about Amaro and the future of the Phillies with him:<br /><br />Here is an example from 2010:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>Holy cow, this team has gotten depressing in a big damn hurry. <br /><br />Remember when this team could take a walk? What the hell happened? It wasn't losing Jimmy because he never could take one. I'm inclined to partly blame Polanco in the #2 spot setting a bad tone, but he wasn't that bad to start the season. If it really was just the injuries making other players feel like they needed to be more aggressive, then that could be fixed almost overnight, if they relaxed and started being patient. Maybe it's just a bunch of guys having bad years at the same time combined with a slew of injuries. In any case, I'm glad I've missed the past 3 weeks. <br /><br />I can't see how we can trade werth and hope to make the playoffs. He's one of the few guys that can get hot and carry the team for a while. I know the pitching is a nightmare, but they still need to score runs. It's highly unlikely Brown is going to come up and set the world on fire. It just doesn't work that way very often. Translation: either you trade minor leaguers for a starter or two and hope things turn around or you give up on the season and trade werth or Victorino, bring up Brown, and reload for next year. Either way, you don't trade for an aging starter like Oswalt or a 2nd half dud like Haren. If Amaro trades for Oswalt, I'll consider my initial opinion of him to be true -- he's a complete hack and I'll send a big laugh to those who thought he had been playing opossum under Wade and Gillick.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Here's one from 2009:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>I just moved my grade for Amaro from a C to a C-. Ryan Franklin was promised an opportunity to win a starting job, too, but Gillick was smart enough not to give it to him. Even if Park is decent this year, he's no more likely (and I would argue less likely) to be good than Happ and Happ is a much better long term option. The guy deserves credit for pitching well, but he came into camp in great shape and threw the ball like it was Game 7 all spring long. The league will catch up to him by mid-May, possibly earlier, and if they don't, he'll tire in the second half and be even harder to move to the pen. <br /><br />I can see giving it to him if he was head and shoulders above everyone else, but Happ was also very solid. The tie should go to the cheap prospect with the long term upside, especially when the veteran has experience as the long man in the pen. This veteran stuff is exactly the type of thing that worries me most about Amaro. <br /><br />FAIL.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Here's one from 2008<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>I think a lot of people think that a great offense is a given, but that's not the case at all. If Howard puts up the same numbers as last year, but happens to hit closer his average with RISP (very likely), the offense looks very different. Add in the losses of Rowand (he was pretty good in 2007) and Burrell, and suddenly the offense looks a little above average, continuing the slide from 2007's high point. And if Werth's 2008 proves to be an illusion, the offense becomes very average, especially if Utley doesn't come back fast and in game shape. Maybe the pitching will stay healthy again by the grace of the baseball gods, but I don't think we can count on it. <br /><br />They need to add a legitimate offensive player for LF or 3B or they're playing with fire. I'm sure the MainLine millionaires are worried about the economy and protecting all the money they didn't earn, but given the record sales and playoff revenues, there's really no excuse for not adding that bat, either by resigning Burrell or going after someone else. I really don't think Amaro is the guy for the job because I think he's going to try to fill the roster with guys like himself (gritty and unable to hit a baseball). <br /><br />If not for the world championship they just won, I would be much more anxious about it all.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Another from 2008 for not re-signing Burrell:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Amaro = Clueless <br /><br /><br /><br />He got scared, panicked, and crapped the bed. Once again the Phillies misread the market. It's a yearly occurrence.</div></blockquote><br /><br />One more:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Baumann...oops I mean Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>Amaro is starting to remind me of one of those guys who know baseball from a certain year or three and then have that time's version of the game (hitters, pitchers, etc) locked into their mind. Amaro has probably been playing GM in his head for years and can't let go of the players he wanted to get years ago, you know, when those players actually had some value. The game changes, Ruben. Players get old. Their skill sets change once they get in their late 20's, usually for the worse. <br /><br />I think everyone knows casual fans that think this way -- still hung up on some player that was good and had value 5 years ago. I'm starting to think our new GM is like one of these casual fans.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Those aren't bad posts, dave. Did you read them? They are anti-amaro, but most of what I said turned out to be true. Are you trying to make me look good? If so, thanks.<br /><br />Yes, I have regularly said that amaro stinks and that he has mishandled many of the smaller moves (like many other posters, incidentally). I have also given him credit for the bigger moves. I have always said that his problem lies with how he handles the fringe players on the team, which is often the difference between winning and losing. I know several other prominent and respected posters have said the same thing, so I'm not alone.<br /><br />In any case, I have been extremely positive during the season, even when it was popular (and funny?) to do the &quot;we're screwed&quot; thing. If you think that's not the case, then you haven't been paying attention. I could pull up some negative posts from others if I'm allowed to go back 4 years and cherrypick. Maybe even you.</div>

			<div class="content">I never denied that I think Amaro isn't very good. I am positive about the Phillies, not amaro. I think his success is more related to huge increases in payroll, a great youngish core (when he took over), and his willingness to use assets from the farm. I think I can be positive about the Phils given the revenue, farm, and solid core and still be negative about how amaro is using those assets. You took my comments about being positive about the Phillies and have made it sound like I said I have been positive about amaro, which is not true. Of course there are instances where I said I don't like amaro because I don't and have made no secret of it, like a lot of other posters. nevertheless, I have been positive about the Phillies, even when it was popular to be negative. I think the most annoying year I've had on this board is the year everyone was doing the &quot;we suck, game over&quot; thing. I liked the 2008 &quot;we got this&quot; mantra, and I felt that way even before the WFC. That's what I meant about being positive. <br /><br />anyway, I'm going to watch a movie. I remember when you used to be funny. I long for those days almost as much as the days when &quot;we got this.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>phdave wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>JFLNYC wrote:</cite>Whether a team with championship aspirations should allocate to its closer almost four (4) times the salary it's paying to its entire OF combined strikes me as an entirely legitimate question.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't get why you keep bringing this up or what the Phillies should have done about it.  It's just a fluke.  Who cares if the outfielders make a lot less relative to other people on the team?  I wasn't aware that there should be some balance in who gets paid what on a team.  I have no idea what the implications are for making sure the imbalance does not exist.  Should they have signed an expensive FA outfielder just to make it more balanced?  Should they trade an expensive player or two just because several of their outfielders are young and cheap?  Should they not have signed Cole in order to have money to give to Pence or Victorino?  Seems like if you have an older team and you start trying to add in younger players, you are going to have to have these kinds of imbalances. It just so happens that we have three outfield positions open up and this is where we are replacing older with younger players. It's just a coincidence.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />unfortunately the younger players we are plugging in the OF aren't really phenoms.  I would much rather allocate money to the Of instead of a closer in the Phillies situation.</div>

I would much rather allocate money to the Of instead of a closer in the Phillies situation.</div></blockquote><br /><br />To my mind, the last couple years and this year there was no way to lift the Phillies offense above slightly better than mediocre, and the success of the team was predicated on having a starting staff that pitched effectively and deep into games. And thus also having people at the back end of the bullpen who could hold those leads.<br /><br />As we saw last year, if you don't get that from your starting staff, yeah, having a strong closer is a pretty useless luxury (even more so if you don't have effective set-up guys). But if the Phillies are to have a successful year this year, that's still the model they have to follow and so I don't mind overpaying for a closer.<br /><br />Okay, to be honest I'd rather have a great outfield too.</div>
