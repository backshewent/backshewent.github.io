The north coast of Monmouth County might be one exception. I guess what you could call the &quot;Bayshore&quot; area--Cheesequake, Cliffwood Beach, South River, etc.) were hard hit as well, but that's Middlesex County, and not really considered the Shore. Finally, a lot of lower income people haven't moved back--how would the survey count them?</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>It isn't even a poor disaster response. It's just less than perfect (though a tremendous amount of progress has been made). Lots of people lost everything, and most of the disappointment is with insurance companies rather than the state, but you can't undo a lot of the damage. <br /><br />To be honest I'm not even sure what we code Jersey Shore to be at the poll (I think Monmouth/Ocean/Atlantic/Cape May), but whatever it is, a Republican candidate running statewide in New Jersey hasn't won 74% of the vote in a single county in any statewide race since 1985. GHWB getting 72% in Sussex in 1998 is the only time a Republican has broken 70% in any county, and Christie is set to do it along the entire shore region. Clearly, they hate how he's handled things.</div></blockquote><br />The article linked clearly stated that Christie could be pressuring insurance companies and debt collectors to take it easy on those effected, did it not?  Seems like Christie is passing the buck.</div>

Second, while there are some lowish income areas along the shore, some of the hardest hit areas are relatively affluent and I'd assume many of those people have substantial resources to deal with whatever they need to deal with. The north coast of Monmouth County might be one exception. I guess what you could call the &quot;Bayshore&quot; area--Cheesequake, Cliffwood Beach, South River, etc.) were hard hit as well, but that's Middlesex County, and not really considered the Shore. Finally, a lot of lower income people haven't moved back--how would the survey count them?</div></blockquote><br />Well sure, we'll see what happens in a few weeks. The poll could be wrong (note: this is the same pool of respondents who had Booker beating Lonegan by 22, so it's already been wrong once!). Subsamples have higher margins for error, and people who used to live in those counties presumably would count elsewhere, though a lot of people who are out of their houses are renting nearby. But it's my sense most people who've been affected think he and the state have done a pretty good job given the circumstances, at least going off of people I know. A lot of people are still displaced or suffering from the effects in other ways, and some subset of them are probably not pleased with Christie or the state, and some further subset of them probably have legitimate grips, but with such a big catastrophe not everything's gonna be perfect. His passion, energy and focus on working with national figures and local leaders on fixing things that were broken are clear as day to anyone paying attention.</div>

The Asbury Park Press reported in August that the firm hired to run the campaign, a lobbying and public affairs company led by a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who had recently brought on well-connected Republicans, had been chosen over an advertising firm that had bid 40 percent less but that did not propose using the governor’s family in the spots. The firm chosen then hired an advertising agency that already worked for state agencies. </div></blockquote><br />I wonder if that ~2MM could have helped some people out rather than trying to score some political points for the Gov.<br /><br />None of this in isolation really upsets me, it's how politics works and I'm sure it's not Christie's fault entirely that everything is not running as smoothly as planned, just like I'm sure it's not all Obama's fault that healthcare.gov's launch has been touch and go.</div>

			<div class="content">The comparison of Christie on Sandy to Obama on healthcare.gov is beyond laughable. Healthcare.gov is the website that the Obama administration created to help facilitate the enactment of its signature policy achievement of its first term. They set the parameters/deadlines/objectives. It was all voluntary and their idea. Sandy wasn't Chris Christie's policy brainchild. It was a catastrophic, once in a generation type storm that destroyed a big chunk of the state. Running into problems in responding to a cataclysmic outside event is different than not living up to basic expectations from your own law. When you are the person that starts the ball rolling on a program, you own subsequent difficulties in a way that someone reacting to an unexpected natural disaster does not.<br /><br />And the shore was open by Memorial Day, although it will take years for it to be back to normal. It was important for him to keep pushing a positive line to get people down there visiting to help out the storeowners and everyone else who relies on Summer tourism to make their living. If you went down this summer, chances are things were things were different than in the past depending on what beach you go to, but most of the stores were open and the ocean was still there. Huge gulf between 'open' and 'fully recovered'.</div>

It seems like any time any kind of major changes gets put into law, it takes awhile for it to run like it's supposed to.  I'm not sure why everyone is surprised.</div>

			<div class="content">Addressing the budget issue should be quite simple. The difficult step is to get people to recognize that various tax deductions (for instance the fact that health insurance provided by an employer amounts to tax free income or the mortgage interest deduction) are from an economic and fiscal perspective, expenditures. So, by cutting those things, you are in fact shrinking government and cutting spending, not raising taxes. This is of course not easy, since there are legions of interest groups that will try to convince you otherwise. But they are liars. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/10/25/ted-cruz-doesnt-know-what-the-government-gives-him-hes-not-alone/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mon ... not-alone/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So, that's one approach. Maybe you combine it with an overall lowering of rates. Or maybe you just do a little at the edges--maybe you don't touch the mortgage deduction or health insurance now, but go after other deductions, particularly on the corporate side. But you don't make it revenue neutral, you make it revenue positive, because it's really a spending cut. <br /><br />But the real deal is to trade off sequester spending for entitlement reforms. And you have to reform those entitlements, especially medicare. People are going to like it. But you get people to come around on it through a judicious use of pork and current spending. Use the short termism of most political actors to your advantage.</div>

It may be a smaller share in large urban areas.

			<div class="content">When we went down the shore Labor Day week, I had a conversation with a bakery owner who felt like Christie had if anything overstated the devastation early--to press the case for federal relief--then did the &quot;Stronger than the Storm&quot; ads too late to draw back people who'd made alternative vacation plans, but perfectly timed to bolster his own political fortunes. She said that local business was down about 40 percent for the summer, while shore communities in Delaware and Maryland had a really great year. <br /><br />I don't think this was anything like malice on Christie's part, but it seemed like a valid argument against him.</div>
