Sure, these threads have their moments, but I've been on a lot of message boards over the past 15 or so years, and this is easily one of the most consistently respectful political discussions I've ever encountered. Even on the UVA message board--where you presumably have people who come from pretty similar backgrounds--the politics message board is typically a dumpster fire. These threads occasionally devolve into name calling and can get emotional, but I think that we also do a pretty good job of self-policing on that point.</div></blockquote><br />i agree with you. like i said, i read lots of politics subforums on other message boards-- both liberal and conservatives-- and this board is nowhere near bad</div>

He is our president, elected, and will take office. Its your obligation as a citizen to make this country work. You have to work to make it what it should be. It is a GOP sweep in all branches and a majority of the states. That is the job, make it work. If you sit and pout and blame others, then you are doing nothing. If you protest, force change, demand true justice, and hold accountable our elected officials to governed the will of the people as focused by the constitution, then you are working in the right direction. <br /><br />Lets go old school with 'United we Stand, Divided We Fall.'

			<div class="content">the record probably disagrees or whatever but I've tried to be slightly less sarcastic and miserable in the political threads as compared to other places so there could be some discourse but literally fuck that right now. A good number of my friends have required emotional support because their lives are significantly less safe, their rights are most likely going to lose their protections etc. I'm supposed to feel bad because conservatives are getting heckled on the internet? Fuck that, if I'm crying over anything it's the burned down black churches and LGBT folks getting their asses kicked by angry, uninformed shitheads.</div>

Lots of people stayed on the sidelines. We need to see how better to engage them. I'm convinced the reason Clinton lost (besides the FBI thing) is the economic message wasn't properly conveyed. For the good of the country we should figure out what the hell we're (I say this as a Democrat and non-Trumpist) doing going forward. Politics matters and it affects lives. We need to show this. It was frustrating to read post-mortems where people didn't make the connection to their liking Item A and then voting for the person that wants to take Item A away.</div>

I'm just explaining that I don't enjoy posting in this thread anymore, and I actually think if I started posting more, then everyone (me, you and others) would be less happy. This is a safe place to lament the decision to elect a sexual predator, and I'm aware enough to realize that nuanced posts about how the GOP may not burn it all down would not be welcomed.</div>

You have to work to make it what it should be. It is a GOP sweep in all branches and a majority of the states. That is the job, make it work.

I think a lot of liberals like myself (and especially those who live in blue states like NY) have become complacent the last 8 years and during the election.  <br /><br />This election has been a rude awakening for a lot of us progressives, especially millennials.

Basically in retrospect it's clear that the democrats were wrong to punt on appealing to working class values. They thought they had a winning coalition of minorities and certain groups of women, and so they focused their message on stuff that would appeal to those groups, with the hope that enough college educated white people would be grossed out by trump and come along for the ride. <br /><br />In the end, there was a shift among college educated whites, but women and most minority groups (including Hispanics ffs) voted for Hillary at lower rate than Obama in 2012. <br /><br />That sort of tells me that people largely had their minds made up on whether trumps actions and words were disqualifying. And there was an opportunity that they missed to appeal to working class ideas that, yes, appeal to white men, but also appeal to everyone. <br /><br />Contrast that with 2012 when the auto bailout was front and center. Mitt was painted as the personification of the financial crisis, they guy that fired you from your job during the recession.<br /><br />There was a way to run the Romney playbook against trump, but clearly they thought not stressing what a xenophobe he was would normalize him. <br /><br />Not saying that was an easy call, but in retrospect an adjustment needs to be made if they want to win next time.</div>
