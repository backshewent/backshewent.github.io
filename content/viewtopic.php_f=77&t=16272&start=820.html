She's earned what she has. I personally would rather vote for someone else, but I know I'll like her politics more than I will Jeb or Walker or whoever.<br /><br />Besides, I was just defending her from the constant GOP investigations that lead nowhere. And I was commenting about the psychology of what they are really trying to accomplish. The truth doesn't matter. The act of investigating is enough.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Monkeyboy wrote:</cite>(<span style="font-weight: bold">disclaimer: I have no idea what the foundation does)</span></div></blockquote><br />The Clinton Foundation is sort of a central repository for philanthropic efforts and causes aimed at improving the lives of people across the world.  It's estimated that The Clinton Foundation has had a positive effect on about 5% of the world's population.<br /><br />Here's a brief list (google copy/paste) of some of the stuff they've done.<br /><br /><ul>- Through The Clinton Foundation, a new kind of disaster recovery that enabled the communities of South Asia to “build back better” after the tsunami. This model has also been used in relief and recovery in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and in Haiti.<br /><br />- Working with 20,000 schools across all 50 states to provide healthier school meals and create better learning environments.<br /><br />- Secured a 45 percent reduction in the price for pentavalent vaccine, which will result in an estimated $150 million in savings over the next four years. The vaccine offers protection for children against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, and Haemophilius influenzae type b, which causes pneumonia and meningitis.<br /><br />- The Initiative's strategic partnerships and investments in health and wellness, worth $100 million, will impact more than 50 million people across the United States — that's 1 out of every 6 people.<br /><br />- The Clinton Climate Initiative is impacting 1,300 people by providing home energy retrofits and reducing 4,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually across the country.<br /><br />- In partnership with Facebook and The Jed Foundation, created &quot;Help A Friend In Need&quot; – a community guide to help people identify when a friend is in distress and address the risk of suicide on college campuses.<br /><br />- 50,000 cataract surgeries in Peru, enabling thousands of individuals to return to work and increase their incomes.<br /><br />- Through a commitment from Procter & Gamble, The Clinton Global Initiative is providing safe drinking water in Africa with the PUR water purification system.  The PUR water purification system was created by Procter & Gamble’s Health Sciences Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br /><br />- Strengthening health systems and expanding access to lifesaving treatments (Africa).<br /><br />- Addressing climate change by making forests and cities more sustainable (Africa).<br /><br />- Programs focused on empowering smallholder farmers to increase their yields and access new markets, which has resulted in 4,300 farmers feeding 30,000 people in Rwanda and 4.5 million trees planted in Malawi and Rwanda.<br /><br />- Grants and investments to support Haitian entrepreneurs, small businesses, and farming cooperatives, and helped to facilitate more than $30 million in direct foreign investment in Haiti.</ul><br />Obviously, <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS EVIL AND MUST BE DESTROYED!!!</span></span></div>

			<div class="content">I had heard the criticism of the foundation and I knew it was set up to help people. I didn't know exactly what they did (the stuff in pip's list). <br /><br />My point is that I don't need to know anything about it at this point because the GOP has no credibility in drawing my attention to supposed misdeeds. I can be completely ignorant of what the foundation does and still know the allegations aren't worth reading about at this point. I won't waste my time reading about something that will almost certainly, based on past experience, turn out to be nothing. If the allegations end up being investigated a bit and turn out to be more than nothing, I'll then read about it. <br /><br />Sorry I didn't explain it more clearly, and less ironically, the first time.</div>

			<div class="content">To posts from soren, pacino, others from yesterday<br /><br />-I do think money equals speech, and it is important that the ability to spend on political speech is protected under the first amendment. Without the ability to publicize your ideas with $$ the first amendment is useless. You're allowed to speak, apparently, but not allowed to buy a megaphone. When the presumptive Democratic nominee for president says that overturning Citizens United is going to be a litmus test for her Supreme Court appointments, it should be mentioned that Citizens United was a case about publicizing a movie against Hillary Clinton while she was running for president. This is important stuff that citizens of the United States should be allowed to band together and produce and promote. The attempts to smother this type of speech under BCRA or other means are an attack on the core of the first amendment.<br /><br />-I agree with my beloved governor that the solution is to move to a system where you can donate unlimited amounts of money to a candidate or cause, but it is disclosed within 48 hours. The current system is very flawed due to dark money, but this does not mean the proper solution is to ban most of the spending. Money will always find a way into the political process as long as the political process holds control over money.<br /><br />-I think many concerns about donations leading to corruption in political decision making are overblown because most donor support stems from already shared common ground with the candidate the donor is backing. This does not mean that politicians are immune to bribery or following donor wishes, but most of the relationship between donations and candidates flows in the direction of donors supporting politicians who are in agreement with their preferred issue stance. <br /><br />-One area where the research is pretty clear is donations lead to access. I think it is a reasonable distinction to draw if you think it should be constitutionally required for Americans to be allowed to donate money to political campaigns and causes, but highly suspect for foreign governments to give large sums of money to a politically connected charity. At minimum, I think the foreign governments thought they were buying increased access to Hillary as Sec State/potential future president. I don't believe the Clintons would be swayed to be nicer to Saudi Arabia or whatever due to them giving money to the foundation, but with the uranium story from a few weeks ago it seems like there's reason for skepticism about the endeavor generally.<br /><br />-The first four dashes are pretty much irrelevant to the NYT article I posted yesterday, and the responses from y'all were nothing more than deflecting. Anyone who thinks the bit about Blumenthal and Hillary and Libya is related to Citizens United or money in politics (as the phrase is typically used) didn't read the article. Blumenthal is not known because he is a Clinton donor. He did not curry favor with Hillary through campaign funding and use this to open the door to contracts in Libya. Blumenthal is a long time Clinton crony who was doing work for Hillary on the side in spite of the fact that the Obama administration did not seem to want him working for the State Department. It is interesting that it appears Clinton was able to get around this in part using money from the foundation to pay him, but that's something of a sideshow to the story. Blumenthal's motivations - trying to get Hillary the best info, trying to set the situation in Libya up for his business partners, some combo of a and b - are unclear in the article. Whether Hillary even knew Blumenthal wanted to be engaged in Libya after Gaddafi through business projects was also unclear. Hopefully if he testifies before the Benghazi committee more will come to light. It does seem clear to me anyway that Hillary trusting him while he was passing along crappy info and her making sure this got to the various principals in government as a source close to the Secretary was not a great thing. I would think pretty much everyone who reads the article would find it troubling, but I've been wrong before.</div>

			<div class="content">a 'megaphone' drowns out other speech<br /><br />and of course it was about money in politics, Blumenthal is a long-time advisor (one man's advisor is another man's crony and vice versa). She apparently showed his findings but they did not act on it. There's no actual governmental issue other than his private access to her accrued through years of political friendship which she apparently did nothing with on her end.  and he was paid by the Foundation. So, money.<br /><br />where are you on all the neocons swirling about Jeb, no doubt ready to pounce and get back in power both in and out of government?  Where were you on Halliburton and Cheney? Where were you on how many revolving door nominations, board memberships, lobbying, etc for countless politicians and bureaucrats? <br /><br />AND IT IS NOT ELECTION SEASON. We are still 1.5 years away from the election. Can everyone please stop?!<br /><br /><br />edit: I just realized the hilarity in getting on Blumenthal for peddling bad info...</div>

I think Blumenthal probably thought he was helping. Problem is the Clintons have their group of loyalists, and they trust them and rely on them even in areas like this where it would seem they have no qualifications for being involved. Blumenthal was there for them during the Lewinsky scandal, so he's worth listening to about internal Libyan political dynamics. Arguably not an appealing trait in a potential president, but pacino has deemed this unimportant, so I will move on.</div>
