			<div class="content">Mark Warnrer’s Campaign has been running ads that are more like PSAs. I guess his opposition is such a nonstarter that he’s not even really running campaign ads. I was actually floored when I found a debate on NBC with his competitor. I guess I was especially surprised because the moderators included Chuck Todd, but that makes sense because the NBC affiliate in DC is owned by the parent company, and what was Chuck doing on Wednesday night anyway. <br /><br />I honestly couldn’t make it through the opening remarks since the guy running against Warner restating his positions on things that immediately fell into the flip-flop attack. I really wasn’t learning anything about the guy except that he is taking the old-school mad dog attack approach to politics. <br /><br />I previously got something stuck on my door about him except that he went on and on about how he’s an outsider, after retiring from the military, where he worked with the Bush administration, and also where he got his masters degree and PhD in public administration. Sounds like a guy has been auditioning for the part for a long time really.<br /><br /> Warner’s lead is 52% to 39% with a 3.2% margin of error.</div>

			<div class="content">Yeah. Or just drop it off in person. <br /><br />The only issue with VBM is they can't start opening the ballots until 7am on election day. It's just going to take time. BUT the counties now know that. They'll be better prepared and have way more staff. <br /><br />Delco rented a huge warehouse in Chester. Chesco us using a gym and West Chester University. Counties are intimately aware of how best to handle this and have been making plans for months.</div>

			<div class="content">Interesting &quot;Daily&quot; podcast yesterday with a politically connected pro-life advocate.  The discussion centered around how this organization has been building to this moment for 25 years and now that it is at hand, they are pushing all the chips in.  She was very composed, picked her words carefully and she was extremely diplomatic in the approach.  She emphasized the most important thing on her agenda and should be for every Republican is to get the Supreme Court in a position to overturn Roe v Wade.  Suggesting everything else should be cast aside in order to achieve this goal.  Host Michael Babaro pointed out how RGB actually did not like the Roe v Wade verdict bc it went so far and was so absolute that it left too many adversaries and that it would lead to this moment in time.  He asked the advocate if taking this measure of a quick appointment may have the same result.  She didn't think so but she said it ultimately didn't matter as long as the end goal is achieved.  It will leave abortion rights to the states.  <br /><br />This left me thinking that as painful as it may be to lose Roe v Wade and the suffering it will cause for so many people, it may also ultimately bring about the end of the Republican party as we know it.  The idea being Republican politicians will foresake most of their agenda in order to focus on this sole position in order to win.  As pointed out in the podcast, the majority of America is pro-choice.  When left to states' rights, there are many states that have Republican control of state government with the electorate not necessarily in lock-step with the pro-life leaning of the state house.  It seems to me these states could turn more and more blue due to this issue and eventually vote out the pro-life supporters.  Wait until a moderately Republican state loses the right to choose.  It's a long process but one that may eventually bring about change.  Believe me, I don't want to see what appears to be inevitable over these ensuing weeks.  My silver lining is that this next month could be the catalyst for the significant change our democracy really needs even if the change is a slow burn with a long timespan to fruition.</div>
