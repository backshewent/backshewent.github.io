<br />Why would you want one party to mount such a terrible candidate? Is there not a single person in the GOP you'd be ok with as President?  Since re-election campaigns are largely a referendum of the sitting President (as I understand it),  a terrible candidate may have an outside chance of winning if stuff goes to shit.</div>

			<div class="content">I could imagine wanting to see a terrible candidate like Bat-Shit Bachmann nominated for one reason: it might, just might, serve as a mirror to the Republicans (or Democrats, if we were talking about someone like Kucinich and if a guy like that could get nominated by the Dems) showing just how far they've diverged from the political mainstream and valid governance traditions. 
<br />
<br />That said, most of the time I just want to see someone who has a claim on merit and is likely to do minimum harm, even if I strongly disagree with him/her. I was happy to see the Republicans nominate McCain last year, for instance. (Though as the campaign went on I became increasingly concerned that, if he won, we really might see &quot;four more wars.&quot;)</div>

			<div class="content">Who knows what the GOP's going to do for nomination in 2012, maybe offer up some sacrificial lamb and gun for 2016. But even now it's probably too early to tell. Obama certainly wasn't the front-runner for the Dem nomination in 2005. Still, it would be hilarious, Palin times infinity, to see a Bachmann nomination.</div>

Bachmann nominated for one reason: it might, just might, serve as a mirror to the Republicans (or Democrats, if we were talking about someone like Kucinich and if a guy like that could get nominated by the Dems) showing just how far they've diverged from the political mainstream and valid governance traditions. <br /><br />That said, most of the time I just want to see someone who has a claim on merit and is likely to do minimum harm, even if I strongly disagree with him/her. I was happy to see the Republicans nominate McCain last year, for instance. (Though as the campaign went on I became increasingly concerned that, if he won, we really might see &quot;four more wars.&quot;)</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />That was my biggest fear with McCain as well, but ultimately I believe it would have been unfounded. Unlike some bloodthirsty guys (Cheney comes to mind), McCain served and trusts the military. I believe they could have reined in his excesses such that MAX we might have bombed Iran. Yup, rest easy.
<br />
<br />I'm being a little glib obviously, but I believe that it could have been managed. Now, Palin being in the catbird seat for a 2012 nomination ruined the McCain love, but I think, in concert with a Dem Congress, he could have been managed and we would have had an okay presidency.</div>

Since re-election campaigns are largely a referendum of the sitting President (as I understand it),  a terrible candidate may have an outside chance of winning if stuff goes to $#@!.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I think we need a viable and credible Republican party. But I'm not sure what the path is to get there. 
<br />
<br />But one possibility (one I've thought was a good one for some time now) is that such a nomination would split the Republican party. As I see it, the best way to understand the main factions in the Republican party right now are religious populists on the one hand and a more cosmopolitan conservative party on the other. 
<br />
<br />And only the cosmopolitan faction can win. But in order to do so, they need to either silence or cast out the populists. Rove tried to string them along, and was successful for a time. But Rove was limited. He understand the numbers (if the Republicans don't bring in significant Hispanic voters, Texas becomes a blue state probably by 2016, and I don't see any electoral college map that gets the Republicans to 270 ev without Texas) but he did not understand the nature of the &quot;true believers&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Right now, I just don't see the Republicans nominating a Romney or anyone like that. You're talking about a party where having a passport is a liability these days. 
<br />
<br />The historical parallel I'm thinking of is 68 and 72. If McCain is the Republicans Humphrey, the next step (and the rhetoric is clear this is the direction the base wants) is to nominate a McGovern. To be sure, this will be a political season of turmoil, and it won't be pleasant. But I really don't see any other scenario at this point.</div>

<br />I can't help myself. I really want to stop.
<br />
<br />While I was coming up with a dissertation topic, I kept reading these crazy tracts from the English Civil war by nut jobs like Abeizer Coppe. And I was all set to do my dissertation on that stuff. I couldn't help myself. But eventually, I did get over it, though in part with what amounted to an academic intervention of sorts.</div>

<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>On May 11, &quot;stakeholders&quot; including the AMA, PhRMA, the hospitals and the device manufacturers delivered proposals to the White House promising to &quot;voluntarily&quot; reduce cost increases over the next 10 years.  In an effort to keep them &quot;at the table,&quot; Baucus's Chief of Staff  Jon Selib and Finance Committee staffer Russell Sullivan told stakeholders at a May 20 meeting that their participation in the process of crafting a health care bill was contingent on them &quot;holding their fire&quot;:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>    Sources familiar with the lobbyist meeting described it as collegial, but they said Baucusâ€™ aides made clear that any public opposition to the proposed financing of a reform package would be at their clientsâ€™ peril. The staffersâ€™ message to K Street was clear: Tell your clients to let the process work and donâ€™t torpedo it with advertisements, press releases and Web sites.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The goal of keeping stakeholders at the table was threefold: <br /><br />   1. Keep them from advertising against the White House plan<br />   2. Keep them from torpedoing vulnerable Democrats in 2010 so there isn't a repeat of 1994<br />   3. Keep their money out of GOP coffers<br />...<br />Just as it was during the bank bailout, the goal of the White House was clear:  more important than saving the financial system was keeping the financial institutions happy and stop them from financing Republicans.<br /><br />Who would think that way?  Whose primary objective would be to keep anyone from funding a GOP ascendancy, to sell out health care reform worth billions for a hundred fifty million in pro-reform advertising?  Who would think to ask PhRMA to run ads in the districts of vulnerable freshmen, as well as Blue Dog Mike Ross, who is anything BUT vulnerable?  Certainly not some policy wonk.<br /><br />But ask yourself --  would consider it a victory to use the &quot;public plan&quot; as little more than a political pawn with which to threaten stakeholders and force them to stay at the table, with no thought as to the emotional and moral consequences suffered by the people who had pinned their hope on having one?<br /><br />Someone who had worked as the head of the DCCC.  Who remembered the 54 seat swing to the GOP in 1994 after the failure to pass health care reform.  Someone whose sole goal was a &quot;political victory,&quot; so the White House could be 14-0 not &quot;13-1.&quot;  <br /><br />Someone like Rahm Emanuel, who works through the Blue Dogs in the House to make the House bill conform to the deals he sets up in the Senate. </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I'd really like to dismiss this as paranoia. But on the merits, I think she's probably right.</div>

<br />
<br />I'd ordinarily agree, Jeff - really, I would.
<br />
<br />But my feeling is health reform has to be strong, simple & sharp to achieve needed behavior change - a pry bar inserted at the right point, balanced at the right fulcrum, to gain the needed leverage. Compromise certainly will enter in, but compromise as usual is very unlikely to get it done.</div>

<br />He's definitely been more visible and outspoken about gun laws, and there's a real argument that if he weren't up for reelection  Burress might not have even gone to trial. Can't remember if the law itself has changed though.</div>

<br />
<br />You maybe misunderstand me here. I'm not of a &quot;public option or death&quot; view. But everything I've read about how they're doing this aligns with Hamsher's premise: co-opt potential industry opposition (avoiding Clinton mistake #1), let Congress take the lead (avoiding Clinton mistake #2), and (Rahm's words) &quot;put points on the board&quot; rather than necessarily solve the big underlying problem of structurally out-of-control costs. 
<br />
<br />They will make progress on the other big problem, which is the uninsured. But letting the even more institutionally corrupt Congress take the lead and making promises to insurance companies, Pharma and the rest suggests to me that cost control isn't going to happen. If you worry about deficits, as we both do, that's scary. And if your focus, like doc's, is on systemic behavior modification, it's very depressing. We could wind up reinforcing almost everything that's wrong with the status quo, and doing it in the name of &quot;reform.&quot;</div>

<br />I think you're mostly right on this, and it's a good example, but I would add a 4) Pass a less expansive version of the program that costs 40% less than the version the Democrats were proposing and hope that's enough to stop the seniors for begging for more free shit for a decade or two.</div>
