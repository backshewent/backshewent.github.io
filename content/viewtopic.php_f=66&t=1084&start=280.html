<br />
<br />I'm not so sure that is clearly what the founders meant.  Neither is the Court for that matter.  The test for the Establishment Clause was adopted by the Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman in 1971.  The only dissent to the opinion was by Justice White and that was only in part.  The Court (Kennedy has joined opinions using it) views establishment as any action that does not have a secular purpose (clearly not met here), does not have the primary effect of advancing religion as a concept (not met here) or involves excessive entanglement between the government and religion (by definition not met here).  It was adopted with an examination of the signers intent in mind.  Therefore, what the Establishment Clause really means is two things.  That Establishment means that the government shall not make any law where religion in general is either the primary purpose or effect of the law.  And that government should stay as far from any religious involvement has possible hence the excessive entanglement prong.  It means much more then government shall not direct the citizens as to their choice of worship.
<br />
<br />As for the second statement, its fine if you can't comment on the actual legal reasoning.  Though I suggest you try reading some of these opinions for yourself sometime because you are certainly intelligent enough to understand them.  However, if you are not familiar with the actual law and interpretations then you really have no standing to say &quot;But I do know that the four liberal judges have been willing time and time again to disregard the Constitution in order to further the causes they favor; Judge Roberts, not so.&quot;  In all honesty, you don't.  You claim that Roberts (though since he hasn't really been there very long he is not a good example) does not disregard the Constitution.  I have supplied multiple examples of where the Conservatives Justice have disregarded the Constitution.  Are you really so partisan as to think that Conservatives do not use the Court to advance causes they favor as well.  Look at the Rhenquist Court's decision in Lopez where they dramatically curtailed the Commerce power.  That disregarded the Constitution's necessary and proper clause to advance the cause that they favored which was a reduction of federal power.  I happened to agree with them in this case.</div>

The Court rests its decision on distinguishing from Grutter v. Bollinger.  They claim that Grutter is different because in a University setting there is a specialized need for a diverse student body.  Of course, the entire thrust of the Brown decision is that scientifically it is shown that it is most important to expose children to diversity in their formative years.  At least Scalia's opinions are legally sound and reasoned.  <br /><br />It's amazing how with it Stevens remains.  You could argue that his brief personal dissent was mostly the work of law clerks but I doubt law clerks would have disagreed with C.J. Roberts in such a paternalistic and at times patronizing manner.<br /><br />Justice Breyer's dissent is actually quite moving.  He points out what to me is the most inherent flaw of the Chief's reasoning which is that while the state has to show a compelling interest, remedying past effects of discrimination qualifies.  That is of course, the essence of Brown and its progeny.  The de facto, de jure distinction, to me, is inapplicable in the race discrimination arena.  The question is whether there is state action, not only state legal action.</div></blockquote><br /><br />If I were in the habit of regular prayer, Stevens' good health and abiding with it-ness would be way high up on the list.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Not unexpected but good news for you.  Justice Stevens will not be leaving the Court in the next year (god willing) as he has completed law clerk hiring.  Same thing for Justice Ginsburg who reportedly has already hiring someone for the 2009 term.</div>

In other words, the impression is that unless you are a corporation, shut [...] up and don't start trouble. But if you are a corporation?

<br />Now, I happen to think that the Boy Scouts have been wrong-headed about gays.

Again and again, he's spoken about seeking consensus and respecting precedent, in the tradition of John Marshall. I forget who said it, but the quote was something like &quot;He can be a great Chief Justice, or he can be a right-wing hack. He can't do both.&quot; <br /><br />Seems like Roberts has made his choice, and I suspect one result--beyond the damage he's doing to our laws and our society--will be that the confirmation process is going to get even more debased. Any Democrat who believes the sort of lies Roberts spouted at his hearings will face an enraged activist base, and understandably so.</div></blockquote><br /><br />From the WSJ OpinionJournal, a somewhat less hyperbolic view of Judge Roberts:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">A Cautious Right Turn </span><br />The Supremes were most united on business cases. <br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Saturday, June 30, 2007 12:01 a.m. EDT </span><br /><br />A Supreme Court Justice once told us never to underestimate the difference even a single new Justice can have on the nine-member body. We certainly learned that lesson this year, the Court's first full term with Associate Justice Samuel Alito. The Court has moved notably back to the center, but its alleged new &quot;conservatism&quot; is more in temperament than politics.<br /><br />You wouldn't know this from the horror masks brandished on the political left, which is reacting as if the Court had laid waste to a generation of precedents. .... Such hyperbole is best understood as Democratic base mobilization for the 2008 election. <br /><br />The truth is that the High Court went out of its way not to overturn precedents. This is in part due to the jump-ball jurisprudence of Anthony Kennedy, who found himself on the winning side of all 24 5-4 decisions this term. ....<br /><br />But incrementalism was also the way of Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes even when Justice Kennedy would have gone further. In Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, the Chief's majority 5-4 opinion shied away from overturning the Court's 2003 ruling on the Constitutionality of campaign finance reform laws in McConnell v. FEC. That 2003 majority was hardly some &quot;super-duper precedent&quot; of long standing, yet the Chief Justice courted the scorn of Antonin Scalia, whose concurrence would have declared the entire Rube Goldberg structure of the McCain-Feingold statute to be an unconstitutional abridgement of political speech.<br /><br />The Chief Justice's caution, we should add, is markedly different from the liberal majority's penchant for overturning precedents when it had the votes in recent years. Recall Lawrence v. Texas, which in 2003 overturned Bowers v. Hardwick and created a potential legal framework for gay marriage, and Roper v. Simmons, which in 2005 outlawed the juvenile death penalty and overturned 20 state laws. <br /><br />.....<br /><br />The good news is that the Court did set clearer rules this year on several notable business cases, which united Justices on both the right and left in solid majorities reining in class-action lawsuits, employment law and patents. <br /><br />In Credit Suisse First Boston v. Billing earlier this month, a seven-Justice majority dismissed an antitrust claim against investment banks from the days of the hi-tech bubble that would have been a tort lawyer's dream. And in the antitrust case of Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, seven Justices dismissed the idea that the mere suggestion of a conspiracy was enough to bring charges of anti-consumer collusion. The press is calling these &quot;pro-business&quot; rulings, but it's more accurate to say they were about restoring business confidence in the rule of law and setting limits on the tort bar and activist judges. <br /><br />President Bush has had a rough second term, but on their record so far he made the right choices in picking Justices Roberts and Alito. Liberal interest groups and their media echoes may shout about a &quot;radical&quot; Court and &quot;resegregation.&quot; But the new Justices ruled very much as they advertised in their confirmation hearings, with Chief Justice Roberts relatively more inclined to uphold precedent than Justice Alito.<br /> <br />.... <br /></div></blockquote>

<br />
<br />I have lost nearly all confidence in President Bush, who cannot manage Iraq, gives me little confidence that he can serve the role needed in relation to Israel, Palestine, and Iran, who busies himself with non-issues like stem cell research, and who has presided over horrible wasteful programs like NCLB and the medicare prescriptions. But with his judicial appointments, he gets an A+.  In that important role, he could not have done better.  I only wish he could get one more shot.  Worse case scenario, though, is that President Gore gets to replace Baby Ruth and Stevens, maintaining the current makeup with Kennedy as swing voter. We are guaranteed to get a woman, and probably a minority, but it's hard to imagine the court confirming anyone left of Ruth or Stevens. I have to presume that Gore will get only 4 years, and hope that Kennedy and the four conservatives hold the fort for those years.</div>

<br />
<br />I wanted to point out to everyone that there is an editorial in the Inquirer today on the school segregation case that I thought was surprisingly excellent. 
<br />
<br />TP:
<br />
<br />I'm sure you understand how stare decisis and precedent.  Roberts cannot just go back to previous holdings and skip over ones even if they were adopted by more liberal courts.  For instance, even though the Court this week basically reinstated Plessy v. Ferguson, it still has to deal with the cases on the books.  
<br />
<br />&quot;If Judges were to rule in ways that only reinforce prior rulings, what is the point of having judges and new cases?&quot;  Well technically, judges must only enforce old rulings, only Justices do not.  The answer of what's the point though should be obvious.  The necessity of a judicial system is to provide notice and consistency to the citizenship (and a method of enforcement).   Would you have purchased your car or house if the laws of contract could just be changed at the whim of every Judge?  Judges (more appropriately triers of fact) are necessary because we have rules of law but they still must be applied to the facts of the particular case.   
<br />
<br />Only Justices may change the law but they do so with a heavy burden.  To deviate from precedent, from the consistency and predictability that is the legitimacy of the legal system, the Justices must explain why the change is being made and to expressly overrule prior holdings.  The gutlessness of the current bench has left lower courts in a precarious position.  They left Brown undisturbed which holds school desegregation as a compelling state interest but depart from that this week.  Roberts and Scalito want their cake and to eat it too.  They want to practically overrule Brown but without the public relations fallout of being the justices to do that.  
<br />
<br />On another note, it would be nice if you could refrain from continuous use phrases like liberal activist courts.  Just say that you do not agree with specific decisions that others have made with specific reasons for why you believe their interpretation of the law or the Constitution is incorrect.  We are all interested in honest conversation with intelligent people.  If I wanted dismissive catchphrases to substitute for real debate of legitimate Constitutional differences, I would just get my legal analysis from Sean Hannity.</div>

<br />Yours does. If you're looking for a left counterweight to the Opinion Journal, try The Nation. They're simpleminded partisans too, and they're just as blindly reactive.</div>

<br />
<br />I completely disagree.
<br />
<br />If we are going to use terms like &quot;simple-minded partisans,&quot; that surely applies more readily to the Inky than to the WSJ.
<br />
<br />I can't think of another source where the editorial page differs so completely from the the news coverage.  The WSJ op-ed is solid right, and none of that bleeds into the news coverage, which actually tilts slightly left.  For the Inky and the NYT, however, the op-ed is solid left, and it permeates the entire paper, be it A&E, news, or sports.
<br />
<br />Read the NYT today -- the cover story on the SC.  Pretty good, by NYT standards, but clearly tilted left.  If you cannot figure out how, let me know and I'll be happy to explain.</div>

<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Like Bush and unlike Churchill, Chamberlain came to office with almost no understanding of foreign affairs or experience in dealing with international leaders. Nonetheless, he was convinced that he alone could bring Hitler and Benito Mussolini to heel. He surrounded himself with like-minded advisers and refused to heed anyone who told him otherwise.<br /><br />In the months leading up to World War II, Chamberlain and his men saw little need to build up a strong coalition of European allies with which to confront Nazi Germany -- ignoring appeals from Churchill and others to fashion a &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; of nations to thwart the threat that Hitler posed to the continent.<br /><br />Unlike Bush and Chamberlain, Churchill was never in favor of his country going it alone. Throughout the 1930s, while urging Britain to rearm, he also strongly supported using the newborn League of Nations -- the forerunner to today's United Nations -- to provide one-for-all-and-all-for-one security to smaller countries. After the League failed to stop fascism's march, Churchill was adamant that, to beat Hitler, Britain must form a true partnership with France and even reach agreement with the despised Soviet Union, neither of which Chamberlain was willing to do.<br /><br />Like Bush, Chamberlain also laid claim to unprecedented executive authority, evading the checks and balances that are supposed to constrain the office of prime minister. He scorned dissenting views, both inside and outside government. When Chamberlain arranged his face-to-face meetings with Hitler in 1938 that ended in the catastrophic Munich conference, he did so without consulting his cabinet, which, under the British system, is responsible for making policy. He also bypassed the House of Commons, leading Harold Macmillan, a future Tory prime minister who was then an anti-appeasement MP, to complain that Chamberlain was treating Parliament &quot;like a Reichstag, to meet only to hear the orations and to register the decrees of the government of the day.&quot;<br /><br />As was true of Bush and the Republicans before the 2006 midterm elections, Chamberlain and his Tories had a large majority in the Commons, and, as Macmillan noted, the prime minister tended to treat Parliament like a lapdog legislature, existing only to do his bidding. &quot;I secretly feel he hates the House of Commons,&quot; wrote one of Chamberlain's most fervent parliamentary supporters. &quot;Certainly he has a deep contempt for Parliamentary interference.&quot;<br /><br />Churchill, on the other hand, revered Parliament and was appalled by Chamberlain's determination to dominate the Commons in the late 1930s...<br />...<br />Like Bush and his aides, Chamberlain badgered and intimidated the press, restricted journalists' access to sources and claimed that anyone who dared criticize the government was guilty of disloyalty and damaging the national interest. Just as Bush has done, Chamberlain authorized the wiretapping of citizens without court authorization; Churchill was among those whose phones were tapped by the prime minister's subordinates.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The Bush/Churchill parallel has never made sense. Yes, both were to the nobility born, but Churchill was a man who revered learning, welcomed debate and disagreement, thought strategically and generally &quot;did nuance.&quot; Not to mention that he probably wrote more books than Bush has read, or at least understood.</div>
