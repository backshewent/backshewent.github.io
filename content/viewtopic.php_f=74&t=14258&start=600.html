The Romney campaign made plausible assumptions. They turned out to be incorrect, and most of the public polls were closer to being correct. Youth turnout was much higher than they were expecting, and white voters made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate, and that was enough (along with things sliding away in the last week due to Sandy or whatever else).</div></blockquote><br /><br />Assumptions are not plausible if they are contradicted by a mountain of evidence.  This wasn't a thought experiment. There was a lot of data out there and taken as a whole it clearly pointed to an Obama win. I'm thankful that Romney's reliance on echo chamber assumptions only fucked his campaign and not the country like the last Republican administration.</div></blockquote><br />Silver himself suggested there was ample uncertainty about the projection. Why do you think he had Obama at around 70% to win with about a week to go when he had Obama leading in around 10 of 11 swing states? Most of the polling companies had used the same set of projections on voter turnout, and most importantly, they came to these projections knowing the assumptions that the other pollsters were using. Otherwise, yeah, if 15 of 18 pollsters (or whatever proportion it was) had independently made these estimates, then it would hold much more weight. But the mountain of evidence you're alluding to overstates the certainty from the polling.<br /><br />And really, this was a thought experiment. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It doesnt really matter if we know ahead of time who wins.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think Silver's acknowledgment of uncertainty is what distinguishes him from a lot of his contemporaries. Here's a guy that has included tens of thousands of polls into his models, and even he's not certain of the outcome. And on the other side people disregarding a majority of the polls in the face of a lot of empirical data for whatever reason, and they are reportedly blindsided when they end up being full of shit? Come on.</div>

			<div class="content">I do think the Republicans have a math problem. Their belief that the polls were wrong comes from the same mindset that you can cut taxes and increase defense spending and lower the deficit. The only specific cut I heard about was PBS, and given the Republican track record on spending I had no reason to believe they actually were at all serious about reducing the deficit.<br /><br />There's also a Trump problem. There are certainly left equivalents of birthers. But those lefties aren't raising millions of dollars for the Democratic party. The Republican party has a problem dismissing those people. This leads to two problems--first, it makes it easier to paint your party as captured by extremists. <br /><br />But even worse, it become difficult for a low information voter (or even a medium information voter) from distinguishing between loony &quot;Kenyan-Muslin&quot; criticisms of the President and criticisms that actually have validity. Had, for instance, the Benghazi issue been raised by more sober minded people, it might have had some traction with voters. <br /><br />Finally, I do think this was a part of the Dems problem in 2004--it was difficult for many voters to see the distinction between the legitimate criticisms of say Bush's Iraq policy (manipulated intelligence) and the nuttier ones (Bush wanted to get Iraq's oil for his buddies).</div>

Why do you think he had Obama at around 70% to win with about a week to go when he had Obama leading in around 10 of 11 swing states? Most of the polling companies had used the same set of projections on voter turnout, and most importantly, they came to these projections knowing the assumptions that the other pollsters were using. Otherwise, yeah, if 15 of 18 pollsters (or whatever proportion it was) had independently made these estimates, then it would hold much more weight. But the mountain of evidence you're alluding to overstates the certainty from the polling.<br /><br />And really, this was a thought experiment. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It doesnt really matter if we know ahead of time who wins.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think Silver's acknowledgment of uncertainty is what distinguishes him from a lot of his contemporaries. Here's a guy that has included tens of thousands of polls into his models, and even he's not certain of the outcome. And on the other side people disregarding a majority of the polls in the face of a lot of empirical data for whatever reason, and they are reportedly blindsided when they end up being full of shit? Come on.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Also, with a week to go Obama's chances were higher than 70 percent. Pretty sure it was in the low 80s at that point.</div>

			<div class="content">Another important thought--so young people didn't support Romney. And Republicans say that's because they're stupid. But leaving aside social stuff, consider the Ryan plan--whatever its merits, the beneficiaries are clearly those over 55 who would be grandfathered in, and those under 55 would have to settle for a lot less. <br /><br />If you're young, you should be concerned about deficits. A lot. If I'm trying to appeal to young voters. I'm talking non-stop about deficits. And yes, entitlements need reform, but if I'm under thirty and I understand what's going on, I'm going to be pretty pissed off about the idea that those old hippies are going to get to ride off into the sunset in a giant RV while I foot the bill. So any entitlement reform has to cover everyone. HCAA provides some framework for that, if I understand it correctly. <br /><br />Furthermore, the tax issue has a generational aspect as well--presuming most of the 250k plus people are over 45, again, as a young voter it's definitely in my interest to hit them up start paying down the deficit.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>CalvinBall wrote:</cite>Big part of paying down the deficit is getting more people in the work force to bring in more taxes. Did either party connect the two and hammer home that point? I don't really recall.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Sort of, but not in a realistic way--part of Romney's &quot;math&quot; involved tax cuts leading to job growth which would be so enormous that the tax cuts would pay for themselves and more. The problem with this &quot;math&quot; is that it's based on economic theory that simply has never really worked in practice, and even if it did, it would depend a great deal on the specific tax rates involved. (eg, going from 70% to 40% is going to have a different impact than going from 30% to 0.</div>

It's plausible to believe that with a 9% response rate, the polls had a systematic bias. However, we know that people with higher levels of education and older people are more likely to respond to polls than less educated and younger people. So, really, if anything, that would suggest that the polls were undersampling likely Obama voters. They also believed that partisan identification is largely a static characteristic--that people don't switch parties. But there's lots of evidence that PID doesn't work today like it worked 40 years ago--it's fluid, so you can't simply look at the electorate and assume that everyone who was a Republican identifier in 2004 is a Republican identifier in 2012. The unskewed poll guy based his model on this faulty assumption. You simply can't weight polls on party id. Finally, the turnout issue was an interesting one. And experience intelligent hack knows that real enthusiasm has to be for someone, not just against someone. 2004 was the obvious example of this. There really has never been much enthusiasm for Romney, even if there was enthusiasm for getting rid of Obama. So, big increases in turnout over 2008 was unlikely. Finally, why did Republicans count on lower turnout among young voters and ethnic voters? I suppose you could believe that 2012 was going to be different from 2008. But the reality is that youth participation has been increasing steadily since the 90s. On election night, I said that anecdotally it appeared that young people today are much more enthusiastic about voting than young people were 25 years ago. Social media allows for constant reinforcement. Standing on line to vote isn't so bad if you've got a smart phone and bunch of people are tweeting you, encouraging you to stay in line. <br /><br />I suspect the long lines in Florida, if an intentional ploy to drive down minority and youth participation may have had the opposite effect, driving down old white participation.</div>
