			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>kopphanatic wrote:</cite>On the one hand I would love to see Palin somehow make it to the general election season in 2012, either as the GOP nominee or at the head of a splinter group, because it would finally expose the insanity of that wing of the Republican Party.  She would be crushed in the fall after the American public finally saw how dangerous and utterly insane that kind of ideology is, combining a proto-Fascist view of economics with an extremely repressive Evangelical social policy.  After her defeat, the moderate and sane voices in the GOP that have been shut out for 30 years would finally reassert themselves and provide the necessary balance that has been missing in our politics.  But on the other hand, I really want to see her disappear from the national stage and do not want her coming anywhere close to the White House.  I despised Bush, but Palin would be indescribably worse.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that a Palin presidency would mean the end of the republic, either by a full-scale nuclear war that she would start or the complete takeover of far far right wingers who would scrap the Constitution in favor of a dictatorship.</div></blockquote>
<br />Yes, the Republic Party may need its modern version of the McGovern moment before it can regain its sanity and right itself.  I say that as one who happily campaigned for McGovern in my youth.  I was initially going to say McGovern/Goldwater moment, but the Goldwater movement was the launching point for revitalized conservative thinking that eventually led back to the White House and control of Congress.  Like McGovern, I'm fairly sure Palin is a dry hole.  There just isn't any new philosphical underpinning to her.</div>

<br />
<br />The dribs and drabs of stuff that I've read suggests that, one, the Bush administration kept knowledge of some wiretapping and surveillance programs from Congress, to the point where CIA officials flat-out lied; and two, that these programs weren't particularly useful anyway for counter-terrorism purposes. So I got to wondering if, given everything we know about the politics-first inclinations of the Bush White House, there was maybe the tiniest possibility that rather than eavesdropping on suspected terrorists, they were eavesdropping on Democratic candidates and their staffers. Remember, this was 2002, when the Republicans did a lot better than expected in the mid-term elections. Would you really put this past Karl Rove, who within three or four months of 9/11 was talking about how the Republicans could run on anti-terror?
<br />
<br />FWIW, I have no idea whether or not anything like this happened, and just the logistics of it might suggest it's pretty far-fetched. Honestly, though, what really bothers me is that I can't shake the thought that if Rahm Emanuel got incontrovertible evidence that something like this had happened, he'd probably make a political determination that the political cost of announcing it would be too high, and squash the story. 
<br />
<br />If Nixon were alive today, I imagine he'd be thinking he was born just a couple decades too soon. Because now if the president does it, it really is legal, or at least we're willing to pretend it is.</div>

<br />Most of the media were cowed into going along with and actually supporting some of the worst excesses of the Bush administration.  They were all to happy to go along with the 'few rogue actors' explanation for what prisoner mistreatment emerged.  The United States was very frightened and humiliated by 9/11 and this sparked the modern equivalent of the WWII Japanese internment camps.  We had a strong xenophobic reaction that went beyond the small number of AQ and even Taliban members to the whole Arab/Muslim populace.  The quick overthrow of the Taliban and the escape of Bin Laden and his chief lieutenants did not stanch the anger/fear/humiliation.  A big part of the populace was all to happy to see just about any Arab/Muslim killed, humiliated, tortured, deprived of property.  That is why, despite the flimsy reasons, the Iraq venture was so popular.  The media feasted on and joined this public fever.  Now, as the calm has set in, they don't want to look under the rocks and see what is there.  Many will see their own faces staring back at them.</div>

<br />
<br /><blockquote><div><cite>NYTimes Op-Ed guy Ross Douthat wrote:</cite><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/opinion/13douthat.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">The Audacity of the Pope</a><br /><br />....Benedict’s encyclical is nothing if not political. “Caritas in Veritate” promotes a vision of economic solidarity rooted in moral conservatism. It links the dignity of labor to the sanctity of marriage. It praises the redistribution of wealth while emphasizing the importance of decentralized governance. It connects the despoiling of the environment to the mass destruction of human embryos.<br /><br />This is not a message you’re likely to hear in Barack Obama’s next State of the Union, or in the Republican Party’s response. It represents a kind of left-right fusionism with little traction in American politics.<br /><br />But that’s precisely what makes it so relevant and challenging — for Catholics and non-Catholics alike.<br /><br />We’re passing through the worst economic dislocation of the past 80 years.

<br />One of the things I think you might see happen is serious rupture between conservative Catholics and conservative evangelicals. Indeed, the alliance between the two groups is a relatively recent phenomenon in American politics.

<br />Certainly Catholics are Christians, but religion is the original zero sum game.  It is all about you can only be saved if you belong to this denomination or sect, otherwise not a chance.

<br />
<br />I think denominational claims to having the exclusive route to salvation is pretty rare these days. Think about it--the idea of salvation through faith is logically inconsistent with linking salvation to membership. No doubt many protestants hold onto the notion that Catholics believe in justification by works, and that's where the issue you raise would come in. But I'm pretty sure Methodists don't think you have to be a Methodist to be saved, and I know Episcopalians don't think that.</div>
