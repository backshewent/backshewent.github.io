<br />I agree.  Unless the reason that he is preferred is because he is not respected.  Savvy?  I'm not saying this applies to Obama at all, but it's obvious that foreign support will almost always fall on the candidate with a more passive (for lack of a more nuanced word) foreign policy.</div>

<br />And I appreciate nuanced argument maybe as much or more than anyone ever has. I crave it and it completes me. The only reason I'm wont to speak generally in matters like this goes back again to my realm of comprehension. I literally can't imagine what line of logic could lead someone to the conclusion that either Obama is unqualified or that Palin is qualified. So it's not even something that I can see as being <span style="font-style: italic">worth</span> putting forth the effort to make a serious argument.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite>What I find interesting is Obama's comments against NAFTA (which he later partially retracted, if I recall correctly).  What message does this send to our American neighbors, and how do they feel about Obama's tough talk about protecting US jobs?  While I'm a huge supporter of free trade absent any conditions, I don't think Obama's stance should be examined under the lens of foreign countries.  Instead, you should focus EXCLUSIVELY on whether his policies reflect your understanding of the policies he supports, and how it affects <span style="font-weight: bold">the world you live in.</span></div></blockquote>
<br />That last sentence is loaded, though. Given that many of the issues facing us in the next 10-20 years seem to be global (environmental, energy, rise of radical Islam), the scope of the world that I care about is the entire world, not just my day to day world. I probably have this perspective in part because I spend so much of my day-to-day for my job dealing with folks in Japan, Europe, and India, plus I have a vested interest in Israel as a Jew (though so far I haven't been significantly convinced either way that McCain or Obama is better for Israel, they both seem to be pretty strongly pro-Israel).  
<br />
<br />So to me, the world I live in is Earth, and part of my decision making process in picking a candidate is definitely giving &quot;voice&quot; to the folks who want Obama but can't vote for him because they aren't citizens. Overall that's a tiny factor, but Karn and Camp Holdout said it well already--the rest of the world already loves him and respects him as a leader, and I can't see how that is a bad thing. There are about a million other factors that are playing a bigger role in my decision, and the biggest at this point is keeping Sarah Palin in Anchorage.</div>

			<div class="content">here is a more specific example for werthless i find myself thinking about... because i think his question is really important.
<br />
<br />on november 5th there will non-us-citizens who walk past a guy reading a USA Today newspaper (and that will be the exact paper).  this non us-citizen might be a 13 year old boy in pakistan.  or she might be a 10 year old girl in China.  or a 15 year old boy if Iran.  he/she probably wont know the name of the guy on the newspaper cover with his arms raised, but his/her parents probably will.  he/she will see either John McCain or Barack Obama on this newspaper cover.  
<br />
<br />I would like for him to see Barack Obama on this cover because I would like the person holding that newspaper that he sees to have a smile on his face.
<br />
<br />I would like for this experience to somehow factor into him/her not hating america and wanting to blow it up when he/she is 18 years old.  In fact, i'd like that experience to somehow factor into him/her changing their perceptions of some things they might have heard about the kind of people who live in America and whether we are good people or bad people.
<br />
<br />I don't know if it will.  
<br />
<br />So, is that example fair to John McCain/Sarah Palin?  Probably not.  But i believe it to still be important.  And i believe that Barack Obama (rightfully earned or not) is the one who could make this experience possible for a lot of kids/teenagers around the world.</div>

<br />
<br />Bold emphasis is mine.
<br />
<br />I would caution that we need to be careful in assuming that &quot;love&quot; equals &quot;respect as a leader&quot;.
<br />
<br />For example, Reagan wasn't universally loved by any stretch of the imagination, but he was widely respected.</div>

The only reason I'm wont to speak generally in matters like this goes back again to my realm of comprehension. I literally can't imagine what line of logic could lead someone to the conclusion that either Obama is unqualified or that Palin is qualified. So it's not even something that I can see as being <span style="font-style: italic">worth</span> putting forth the effort to make a serious argument.</div></blockquote>
<br />While I think Obama is perfectly qualified, I have low hurdles for what is required to become President.  It's arrogant to assume the line has to be between Obama and Palin.  I can imagine reasonable people that would require a full term in the Senate.  I am not one of these people, but I'm not too full of myself to call them racist on that alone.
<br />
<br />Blanket statements are always bad.  Except when they're appropriate.</div>

			<div class="content">Man, you guys were busy while I was out doing something akin to actual work. 
<br />
<br />The &quot;world opinion&quot; consideration is not zero, but the truth is that America has too big of a market, too mighty a military, and too influential a culture for the world to give us a timeout, regardless of who's in charge. And I think McCain, while perhaps not as palatable to your average Frenchy or Deutchlander or Swede as Obama, is more than capable of winning over world opinion, all things being equal. 
<br />
<br />(What I'm not sure about is that all things are equal. Probably my single biggest concern about McCain is that he'd get us into more wars, and right now nothing would do further harm to our soft power than engaging in more wars.) 
<br />
<br />The difference might be that Obama would have an easier time engaging the world community in nation-building in Iraq or Afghanistan, or building a Bush 41-like coalition against Iran if need be, or taking steps to economically isolate Russia or China for bad behavior. But even that is speculative, and probably has as much to do with how much skill and discretion the Secretary of State has, as with the president's jawboning abilities.
<br />
<br />edit: all bets are off if, god forbid, Palin assumes the presidency. Foreign relations would be disastrous, with the very slight consolation that myriad other disasters would jump ahead in line...</div>
