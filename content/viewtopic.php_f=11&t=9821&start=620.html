			<div class="content">It feels likes it's turned into chinese whispers ever since rosenthal's article.  first we were shipping some prospects to toronto and other than lee keeping our rotation and prospects intact.  then we're moving our prospects plus some rotation plus their prospects to toronto but getting back prospects, and it's all a salary dump.  
<br />
<br />I can understand the first set of rumours.  how it morphed into the second set of rumours is fucking beyond me.  it doesn't pass the bullshit test - i.e. rube didn't make the drabe/happ+prospects deal last summer, so why is he doing it now? they just keep saying 'he's desperate for halladay and needs to clear payroll'.  But he was in a similar position last summer, no? 
<br />
<br />And why is everyone freaking about starks reports, when most of us are of the opinion that stark is rube's bullshit spraying-mouthpiece?</div>

<br />Sure. Even if that did happen, Anthopolous then says OK, you're not going anywhere then. I'll take the two draft picks. Enjoy your flight back to Canada.</div>

<br />
<br />I agree here.  We took a big step down in prospects.  Drabek and Taylor were both going to be Top 25-30 prospects leaguewide I think.  I think maybe 1 of the Seattle guys cracks the Top 100 leaguewide.   Also, in a system overloaded with OFs and devoid of SS, 3Bs we took another OF back?  (Liddi or Triunfel would have at least made more sense).  If we lose Werth in a year, I'm going to be pizzed.

<br />
<br />Salisbury was adamant on the radio this morning that Drabek is gone.
<br />
<br />Is it possible that Amaro & Co. are crafty enough to leak a false rumor about Drabek in order to make the real deal go down easier with the fans?  
<br />
<br />If you had told me yesterday morning that we were trading Lee alone for Seattle prospects and then sending those prospects to Toronto for Halladay and a long-term deal, I would have said that was a good, wise trade - essentially a Lee for Halladay trade, plus a bargain extension.  But if you then told me at the last minute that we'd have to give up Taylor and d'Arnaud to get the deal done, I would have been upset.  But if you let me be upset about a false rumor about losing Drabek for 12 or 14 hours, then I end up happy with losing &quot;just&quot; Lee, Taylor, and d'Arnaud.
<br />
<br />Or maybe Amaro could pull a real shocker and pull out of the trade with Seattle at the last minute and send Drabek and other top prospects directly to Toronto, again leaving us relieved to have Halladay and Lee at the top of the rotation in 2010 (albeit with a decimated farm system).
<br />
<br />Maybe I'm just too optimistic.</div>

<br />That's one way of looking at it.  I tend to think of it as the Lee and Halladay thing never being a real option because of Rube's mistake on Jamie Moyer's contract last year.</div>
