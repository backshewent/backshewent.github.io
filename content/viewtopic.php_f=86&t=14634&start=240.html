I just don't see Bynum as a lock. <br /><br />&quot;If you look at our roster, we have a bunch of guys who have a lot of winning characteristics and we have a bunch of guys who have won a lot. Those aren't always correlated. Like a lot of teams, we believe in guys who have winning characteristics; guys who care about winning, are competitive and want to play, practice and get better - guys who dont want to take plays off and do want to consistently help their teammates by doing the little things that every coach in basketball wants their team to do like sliding over and taking a charge, making the extra pass, getting out and running in transition even if you're not the one who gets to score, making the right defensive rotation, and just sort of consistently following our gameplan.<br /><br />&quot;Those things are all important to us and the problem is they're not often well-measured. But I will say, in aggregate, they're all measured and they're all measured by watching how much they win. How much they win titles, games, quarters, matchups. While we're working hard to measure many of those little things that coaches have forever wanted to have on their teams, you can always measure them in aggregate. So by measuring them in aggregate, with enough patterns and over enough time, you can grow confident that the winning of a player like Shane Battier - who won a national championship in college and state championships in high school - or the winning of a player like Luis Scola - who won at many levels of international basketball - will continue. The same holds true for many of the players on our roster.<br /><br />&quot;Now if that was your sole focus when acquiring talent, you could really make big mistakes. That said, if that winning background exists in combination with some of the other things you're looking for in a player, I think that's a really powerful marker, and it's something we've used in the past.&quot;</div></blockquote><br />That interview was from the 2008 Rockets. Who was the center on that team? Oh, right, it was oft-injured all-NBA talent Yao Ming, who, despite injury questions, was signed to a large, long-term max deal. <br /><br />And are we really questioning the winning characteristics of Andrew Bynum? He has two more rings than everybody on our roster combined. I mean, I know those don't compare to Shane Battier's high school championships, but still, they're something.<br /><br />He's made some stupid decisions (bowling), but it's not like Bynum wasn't in the gym working out trying to come back. He just wasn't physically ready.<br /><br />Gimpy is right on the money here. Do you guys have the same problems with Derrick Rose? Because it's pretty much the exact same situation.<br /><br />The only argument against re-signing Bynum is &quot;Is he able to play basketball?&quot; If not, so be it. But I know this town, and the same people who are shoving Bynum out the door now will be the same people bitching that we didn't keep him when he's putting up 20 and 10 for the Rockets next year.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Nobody ever questioned Rose's motivation when he was healthy.  People questioned Bynum's when he was healthy.  Tex Winter once said he was concerned that Bynum didn't have the inner desire to play basketball.  Kobe and Jackson were constantly pissed at him.  To act like this is the first time Bynum has had people question his desire and that it is purely a physical things is nuts.<br /><br />I'm fine with bringing Bynum back if there is a strong personality in place who can figure out a way to get through to him like Kobe/Phil did.</div>

Values personality.  Possible but I don't think this ensures Bynum is back.</div></blockquote><br />I'm sure he's scouted Andrew Bynum plenty. I've never gotten the impression that teammates had any problem with Bynum, other than Kobe, who hates everyone. Even this year, all the guys were saying they just wanted him to get healthy. Nobody ripped him, not even the loose cannons.<br /><br />I don't think it ensures anything. I said they're going to try to keep him because the Rockets, my frame of reference for his body of work, have been trying to acquire a franchise center forever. They traded for Gasol before Stern vetoed the deal. Like I said, a center who can score inside is such an efficient commodity that I would be surprised if a guy so heavy into analytical data could just wave goodbye to that kind of potential. Obviously if the cost becomes prohibitive, that's a different story.</div></blockquote><br /><br />From our new GM in an interview a few years back. I just don't see Bynum as a lock. <br /><br />&quot;If you look at our roster, we have a bunch of guys who have a lot of winning characteristics and we have a bunch of guys who have won a lot. Those aren't always correlated. Like a lot of teams, we believe in guys who have winning characteristics; guys who care about winning, are competitive and want to play, practice and get better - guys who dont want to take plays off and do want to consistently help their teammates by doing the little things that every coach in basketball wants their team to do like sliding over and taking a charge, making the extra pass, getting out and running in transition even if you're not the one who gets to score, making the right defensive rotation, and just sort of consistently following our gameplan.<br /><br />&quot;Those things are all important to us and the problem is they're not often well-measured. But I will say, in aggregate, they're all measured and they're all measured by watching how much they win. How much they win titles, games, quarters, matchups. While we're working hard to measure many of those little things that coaches have forever wanted to have on their teams, you can always measure them in aggregate. So by measuring them in aggregate, with enough patterns and over enough time, you can grow confident that the winning of a player like Shane Battier - who won a national championship in college and state championships in high school - or the winning of a player like Luis Scola - who won at many levels of international basketball - will continue. The same holds true for many of the players on our roster.<br /><br />&quot;Now if that was your sole focus when acquiring talent, you could really make big mistakes. That said, if that winning background exists in combination with some of the other things you're looking for in a player, I think that's a really powerful marker, and it's something we've used in the past.&quot;</div></blockquote><br />That interview was from the 2008 Rockets. Who was the center on that team? Oh, right, it was oft-injured all-NBA talent Yao Ming, who, despite injury questions, was signed to a large, long-term max deal. <br /><br />And are we really questioning the winning characteristics of Andrew Bynum? He has two more rings than everybody on our roster combined. I mean, I know those don't compare to Shane Battier's high school championships, but still, they're something.<br /><br />He's made some stupid decisions (bowling), but it's not like Bynum wasn't in the gym working out trying to come back. He just wasn't physically ready.<br /><br />Gimpy is right on the money here. Do you guys have the same problems with Derrick Rose? Because it's pretty much the exact same situation.<br /><br />The only argument against re-signing Bynum is &quot;Is he able to play basketball?&quot; If not, so be it. But I know this town, and the same people who are shoving Bynum out the door now will be the same people bitching that we didn't keep him when he's putting up 20 and 10 for the Rockets next year.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Nobody ever questioned Rose's motivation when he was healthy.  People questioned Bynum's when he was healthy.  Tex Winter once said he was concerned that Bynum didn't have the inner desire to play basketball.  Kobe and Jackson were constantly pissed at him.  To act like this is the first time Bynum has had people question his desire and that it is purely a physical things is nuts.<br /><br />I'm fine with bringing Bynum back if there is a strong personality in place who can figure out a way to get through to him like Kobe/Phil did.</div></blockquote><br />Kobe and Jackson are constantly pissed at everybody. People questioned Shaq and Kareem's motivation too. <br /><br />I'm not saying he's a wired basketball machine. I'm just not questioning whether he tried to get back on the court. Even if he doesn't like basketball, when's the last time you guys saw somebody flake out on a contract year where they were guaranteed to get a five year, $100 million dollar contract? If there's anything that tells you Bynum was too hurt to play last year, that's it.</div>

			<div class="content">Love the contract Houston gave Asik last summer that Chicago couldn't match.  These are the kind of moves I'm excited for.  Dude went from bench player to leading the league in overall rebounds.<br /><br />&quot;The deal that the Rockets structured would have meant the Bulls would have been on the hook for a cap hit of almost $15 million in the final year of the contract. The Bulls decided they did not want to absorb such a substantial penalty, given their current cap situation. &quot;</div>
