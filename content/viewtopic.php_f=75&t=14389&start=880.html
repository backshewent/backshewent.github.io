So this list of political sex scandals that made national news in the past decade, scraped from the internets, is far from authoritative, but sure seems lopsided (D's - 9; R's - 24). <br /><br />No doubt there are plenty missing. What frequently makes the R cases more notable is so many R perps so often had loud, proud records of moralizing about their family values. <br /><br />Are sex scandals worthy of closer scrutiny than any other scandals? No. But the most scurrilous behavior by politicians is, paradoxically, usually legal, so doesn't qualify for the 'scandal' label.<br /><br />Now excuse me while I go shower.

			<div class="content">First of all, this whole subject of &quot;which party tends more toward corruption&quot; is really fucking dumb and represents politics on BSG at its partisan scat-throwing worst. <br /><br />Second, I'd be willing to bet that there's a strong correlation between which party tends to hold greater power in a given jurisdiction at a given time, and which has more folks caught stealing money, putting naughty bits where they oughtn't, etc. So Monkeyboy if anything should be hoping for an upswing of Dem corruption. <br /><br />Third, if Menendez goes, I know there's no chance of this but I'd love it if Christie just put Booker in the seat. It'd be politically slick too, because a Republican next year would have better odds vs Lautenberg than Booker.</div>
