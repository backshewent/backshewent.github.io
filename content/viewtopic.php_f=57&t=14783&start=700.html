			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Bucky wrote:</cite>this past offseason was the only disaster IMO.  We had three holes to fill, and he went with three risky propositions.  Revere had the highest upside, so how much does that say.  He needed to fill at least one of those holes with a decent major leaguer somehow, even if it meant going to the farm for the other two.  Of course, the Youngs and 'lil Ben could play like all stars from here on out and make him look prescient.  As long as he doesn't steal my dog's golden poop.</div></blockquote><br />See, I think this off-season wasn't all that bad. Many here assumed the team was going to need a lot to break its way to contend anyway, and it's entirely possible that Amaro concluded the same thing. The pieces he added this off-season have, by and large, been atrocious, but none of them are going to hurt the team long-term, either. Revere might be on his way to legitimately helping.</div>

			<div class="content">The thing I liked (term used loosely) best about the off season moves was how they left 2014 and beyond alone (except for Adams). I wasn't comfortable with any of the big off season trade or free agent possibilities and am really happy now the Phillies didn't pull the trigger on any of them. The off season moves have not helped the team contend this season but I don't consider them disasters. They were low probability of marginal reward at low risk and have so far been unsurprisingly disappointing. There are about a dozen other moves they could have made that I would have considered disasters.  I can't think of one realistic move I wish they made. The bad moves that had the biggest impact on this season were made years ago and I'm glad that Amaro did not double down on them. None of the moves fixed any problems this year but they didn't make any future years worse.  I'm still probably foolishly holding out hope that things turn around this year.</div>

			<div class="content">Michael Young is now approaching 1000 PA of sub-replacement level baseball.  I really don't see that as neutral or getting to neutral.  <br /><br />Schierholtz for Delmon has been worth about -2.5 wins so far.<br /><br />As you all know, I hate Amaro and concede my bias, but I don't think any of the moves this season (save Revere trade) was defensible.  Not when you are entering the final stages of a window to compete for these core players.  Hedging your bet is a great way to get to 80 wins.  I don't know what I would have done and maybe I would have done a worse job, but I know I wouldn't have done what Amaro did.</div>

I thought it would be much better than it has, simply because we had enough options with young arms. I mean, you could quibble with Durbin, but that's not really such a big deal. I would think Amaro also thought it would be quite a bit better (whereas I think the other moves have fallen into the expected parameters). I'm not sure whether it's more bad luck or bad evaluation, but it certainly hasn't worked out so far.</div>

They had a mediocre offense last year.  They acquired Span and suddenly had a 4-man OF (Span-Harper-Werth-Morse).  Adam LaRoche was a free agent, but they resigned him for 2/$22 ($15M mutual option or $2M buyout for 2015).  So they suddenly had a bit of a logjam, but they also have two guys (Werth and Morse) who have been banged up and another guy (Harper) whose style of play screams for DL time.  Instead of going into the season with depth and then waiting to see if they can trade Morse in July if everyone is healthy, they traded him for two pitching prospects (one of whom is a 25 y.o. at AA) and a PTBNL who turned out to be a reliever.  <br /><br />So unless Ian Krol (who was the PTBNL in that deal) insanely overperforms, that move did nothing to help them in 2013.  If they miss the playoffs by a couple of games, it's safe to say that trade was a direct cause.<br /><br />I'm definitely not letting them off the hook for that.  Shockingly, they could've used Morse when Werth and Harper were both on the DL.  He has a better OPS+ than LaRoche anyway despite changing leagues and playing on a terrible offensive team in a terrible offensive park.</div>

If there's no 3B or LF or MR in the organization, that's on Amaro.  He's been GM for 5 years.  This is his organization and his job doesn't just consist of making trades and signing big dollar FA.  He has completely whiffed on Japan and Cuba.  The league is full of guys who were signed cheaply or post-hype prospects that were snatched up and doing well, and presumably could have been obtained of little (Chris Davis, Josh Donaldson, Coco Crisp, Edward Encarnacion, Daniel Nava, Jed Lowrie, Brandon Moss, Seth Smith, Nate McLouth, Aoki, Grilli, Shawn Kelley, Jim Henderson, Tazawa, Uehara, and on and on).  We don't have these guys.</div>

			<div class="content">to a large extent, this is all just hot air. <br /><br />either the front office has a plan or they dont. if they have a plan, i dont know what it is. was it to try and improve incrementally in 2013 with small additions, hope for bouncebacks from their old, injured players and squeeze in to the playoffs? if that was the goal for 2013, was that with one eye on 2014 where they plan to spend big and really turn over the roster? that hasn't been made clear either. its tough to get burned when you make a lot of small, inconsequential deals. but making a lot of small deals, when you have a largely average team, also doesn't really give you a great chance of challenging for the division for 162 games. our roster needed a lot of work after last season. it needed a lot of work at the beginning of spring training, and it still needs work now. and imagine if dom brown hadn't completely come out of nowhere and had a huge first half. i dont think anyone was realistically expecting him to produce what he has.<br /><br />what is the plan for next year? rube admitted in that long piece that the free agent market isnt what it used to be. okay. so what is the plan? because the farm system lacks impact talent as well, especially impact talent close to the big leagues. are we going to shop in the bargain bin again next winter? maybe hes being super secretive and he has it all mapped out. but it appears the plan last winter was basically to tread water. we're barely treading water now. what is the plan for next year? or the year after?<br /><br />i understand things change quickly in this game, but if hes not even looking a year in to the future, you have to question his ability to run a major league baseball team.</div>

I think selling your best hitter for 2013 and acquiring no one costly and getting as many prospects and draft picks as possible is indicative of a plan.
