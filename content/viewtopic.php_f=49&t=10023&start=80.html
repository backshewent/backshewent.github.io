<br />results from markov chains and other monte-carlo methods can be very misleading when applied to problems with more than 4 or 5 significant contributing paraemeters.   it is a little known (because the proof was originally only in russian) fact that when there is enough noise in a (relatively) small data set, very different models can fit the data equally well, and monte-carlo methods might find a good model, but not the best model.   and that's when everything is linear.   if things are nonlinear, the situation can be much worse.   to overcome that you need to turn to advanced simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, or neural nets, combined with some good theorizing from first principles of competitive human behavior.  (something at which matt has more expertise than most).
<br />
<br />i'm concerned that even the vast database of baseball events and run-scoring outcomes isn't good enough to get a reliable model of real run-scoring/preventing skills or of the run value of an event from either inversions or monte-carlo forward modeling procedures that &quot;fit&quot; that data.   lots of noise from the whole curved ball - curved bat interaction combined with lots of important parameter combinations that don't actually recur that often.   by parameter combinations i mean pitcher type + batter type + situation, with each type needing maybe 10 (or more) parameters to describe a player thoroughly so as not to miss out on any real and relevant talent.   a good fit to the past can still turn out to be just plain wrong.
<br />
<br />y'all have a great, great dataset to play with.   and these day you can build yourself a supercomputer for next to nothing.   so i say throw the computational kitchen sink at the problem and see if the model space is really as simple as has been assumed.   markov is a step in that direction, and a big one, but only a step.  when we took the next step in seismology, we found out that those annoying geochemists had been right and that there was an order of magnitude more complexity in the earth than we had been assuming.</div>

<br />not there yet.   if tango replies in usual form, doubling the length of his previous post, with a whole bunch of model results thrown in, together with a deconstruction of the concept of statistical significance... then you've got a real nerd-fight on your hands, but still not an academic pissing contest.    academic pissing only starts when matt and i start posting references to relevant academic journal articles, some of which we've authored....</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>MattS wrote:</cite>I think the reason is that you don't ever concede when they are right, </div></blockquote><br /><br />That is simply not true.  Please find me an instance when I should have conceded but didn't.  <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>and the debate generally descends into methodological assumptions.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You say descends, and I say ASCENDS!<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have a hard time with the argument that BP doesn't want their readers to learn anything.  I would argue that BP is as responsible for casual baseball fans knowing sabermetrics as anybody but Bill James and Michael Lewis.  Using VORP instead of RBI is a bigger gap than VORP to VORP with EqR instead of RC.</div></blockquote><br /><br />They don't want their readers to bother to learn the problems with their metrics.  That is the limitation of what I say they don't want their readers to learn about and nothing more.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> It's not about stripping things down, because if you used BP's methods and BP used your methods, people would use EqA and VORP because that is the way to get linked on your blog.  I'm not talking about elite sabermetricians, I'm talking about still learning ones.  It's easier to get noticed if you get linked on your blog.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You mean if I used a substandard metric, then people would be using those?  No, if I were to produce something that had holes in it, I'd be called out on it, and my influence would decrease substantially.  I will definitely disagree with you here. It almost implies something fairly negative about the readers of my blog, doesn't it?<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It makes assumptions just like regression does.  It makes assumptions that are not all accurate but are close enough in many case.  Regression makes assumptions that can be manipulated to your favor if you know how to manipulate the correlation between the regressors and the noise term. </div></blockquote><br /><br />Sure Markov chains make assumptions.  But I still wouldn't call it simplistic.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Less are subscribers because of your negativity towards BP.  You did a poll and a large fraction weren't.  </div></blockquote><br /><br />I think something like 30-35% of my readers.  Are you suggesting I am UNFAIRLY negative?  Or am I fair?  If I am fair, then there is no issue is there?  If I am unfair, then please cite your examples, because you are casting me in a negative light in this case.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Ultimately, I don't see how you can consider yourself a serious sabermetrician unless reading sabermetrics isn't about doing a literature review.  And you can't complete the literature review of barely any topic in sabermetrics without a subscription to BP.</div></blockquote>  <br /><br />I disagree greatly here.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most topics are hard without reading The Book too, but BP is part of any literature review, and seeing how you encourage that type of thing, you should encourage subscribing.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I encourage readers to read any good sabermetric study.  If that means subscribing to something, then that's what I'll do.  But, I'm not going to encourage more than what I would do.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How about instead of 'behind the paywall' you say, 'complete your literature review at three cents an article.' I think that BP would have way more subscribers if people didn't refuse to pay out of protest.</div></blockquote><br /><br />They have 10,000 subscribers!  Baseball-Reference.com's Play Index has under 1000.   I simply don't believe there is a protest.  Boy, we definiteily don't see the same things the same way!<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>  It's a typical irrationality of economic decision making where people won't pay for something out of principle like that when their utility for the articles is much higher than what they are paying for them.  Many people don't want to pay for baseball on the internet.  They'll spend money on hats and tshirts and everything else baseball related, but they have an aversion to paying for something online.  This is exploited when you convince people they are getting ripped off. <br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Whoah.  I hope that is the royal you, and not me in particular.  In any case, I think BPro is wildly successful.  10,000 paying customers is enormous.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Regardless, the money is spent on a way of his choosing, and therefore the incentive to make money is there all the same.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Wrong.  If it was up to MGL, heâ€™d have sold The Book for no profit, or had it available for all to download for free as a PDF.  He has no monetary incentive to sell The Book.  His only goal was to make the knowledge available for anyone with no barrier, just like all bloggers out there.  But, heâ€™s got partners, and it not up to him. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It's an advertisement for the book in the sense that it encourages people to buy the book.  That you encourage people to read it through Amazon is great, but I never figured out how to do that so I ordered a used copy. </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />As long as you acknowledge that a very tiny percentage of the site exists to sell The Book, then we don't have an issue.  The website exists as a blog to foster discussion about baseball and sabermetrics.</div>

<br />
<br />The Markov chain or simulator is only as good as the parameters it's identifying, and the way they treat themselves dependently or independently.  Yes, limitations, but not simplistic.
<br />
<br />For example, I have the perfect modeler here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tangotiger.net/markov.html">http://tangotiger.net/markov.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It's perfect because it is simply a mathematical construction that uses recursion to calculate how many runs will score.  It can't break because it uses all the principles of baseball, actual baseball.  HR clears the bases, some outs advances runners, etc.  This is UNLIKE all other run estimators which try to match what happens, but invariably breaks down.  For example, do all run estimators for 1 run for a HR?  No.  But, this is an actual principle of baseball.
<br />
<br />Now, for ease of programming, my modeler has a built-in limitation (no outs on base).  Yes, it will limit you if you need to have that. 
<br />
<br />But, it acts as a baseline.  And with the baseline, you can then start figuring how things are affected.  What happens if you go from 30% to 50% to 3b on a single?  Well, now you know.  It's right there.  All other modelers won't know, because they try to build something as an estimate.  Not so the MArkov chain (or simulator).
<br />
<br />A simiulator is more powerful because you can program far more dependencies.  If MAtt for example finds that pitchers that give up lots of walks happen to allow fewer hits per batted ball to RHH, the simulator can handle that.  The Markov chain, once you go past 4 or 5 dimensions, is a bear to program and tweak.
<br />
<br />In any case, I don't know that we actually disagree on anything.</div>

Well, that's a bad job at BPro for not highlighting what's happening elsewhere.  <br /><br />And equally bad job at non-BPro site for not highlighting BPro.

<br />
<br />Yes, Will wrote it.. on his blog, not at BPro.  Dan Fox as well.  Would you believe that they actually took out a mention of The Book as honorable mention by Dan Fox in his book review of Echoes of Green (or whatever it was called).  I have proof.  And Joe Sheehan took out a mention of me in his Jack Morris article?  Joe wrote to me specifically after to say that it was his call to take out the reference.
<br />
<br />I mean, I even ask for the simplest thing like linking to my Fan projects, something that BackSheGoes and SBNAtion and Fangraphs and HArdballTimes and Rob Neyer do without quetion?  BPro?  Sheehan did it several years back, and that's it.
<br />
<br />What is SOMA?
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />I'm willing to bridge whatever gap exists.  My hand is extended.  Tell me what you want me to do, and tell me what you are prepared to do, and let's do it.
<br />
<br />Let's move forward, instead of standing still with all this yapping.</div>
