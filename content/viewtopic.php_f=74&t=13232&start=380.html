			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>swishnicholson wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>jerseyhoya wrote:</cite>He doesn't think it's a right.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Then he should veto it.Putting it to a referendum is just being a weasel. I respect you anyway, but even more so every time you call a weasel a weasel.<br /><br />As Housh says, calling on the majority to establish the rights of a minority is more than a little problematic. You need people of conscience to do so. If Christie doesn't want to accept the will of the people's chosen representatives who see this as the right thing to do because this is not an element of his own conscience, so be it. But putting it a referendum is just passing the buck, and needs to be recognized a such.<br /><br />FWIW I used to wholeheartedly support civil unions until I realized I was supporting something that the people it was supposed to benefit didn't want (and who weren't being provided with the benefits intended anyway.) If you support the benefits that are supposed to be provided by civil unions, I don't know how you don't eventually make the jump to marriage rights. Christie's tarnishing his reputation for fearlessness among all parties with this one.</div></blockquote><br />He is absolutely ducking this. But I don't know if there's a better way for him to handle it. <br /><br />He probably genuinely opposes gay marriage. He is a good Catholic after all. And he has to veto it based on his announced position on the issue and to keep the door open to being VP this time around or running for President in 2016. He could just veto it, but offering a referendum makes it look like he's willing to compromise/being rational, while painting the Democrats as the ones who aren't willing to be reasonable on the issue. <br /><br />Sweeney and a bunch of other legislative Dems were instrumental in killing gay marriage from passing at the end of the Corzine administration two years ago. The Dems brought it back up because they realize that a lot of the people who support Christie for trying to get the state's fiscal house in order and kicking the shit out of the public sector unions also are also social moderate/liberals, and can be won back for the 2013 election by pushing on those issues. Sweeney (the highest ranking Dem in state government for those just joining the conversation) is now calling not backing gay marriage his biggest mistake. Again, this took place in December 2009, not 1999. I mean, whatever, it was politically questionable then so he killed it, now it's useful as a political weapon so he's for it. Christie is responding to this cynical political play in cynical fashion. Quelle horreur. <br /><br />Whatever the merits of putting this civil right up to popular vote, I think it would stand a really good shot at passing, and I'm pretty sure it'd be the first time gay marriage won a referendum.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Well a duck isn't quite a weasel but I'll settle. And Sweeney is a toad and other gutless Dems like James Beach deserve as much excoriation as they can get for their actions in 2009. But I don't really see &quot;Christie is responding to this cynical political play in cynical fashion&quot; as a defense, unless you're, y'know, completely cynical. I also question the depth Christie's opposition to gay marriage and think he's just considering political expediency at this is time-which is generally the case when he's acting rather than blustering over things he has no control over. I think he might find this high wire is a little thinner than he thinks. But he has generally displayed a good sense of balance in the past, so maybe not.</div>

			<div class="content">I didn't mean to say him suggesting the issue should be put up for referendum in response to the Dems acting cynically in bringing this back forward should exonerate him from his actions, but it's worth taking the past into account. And a lot of NJ politics are best viewed through a completely cynical lens.<br /><br />As for questioning his depth of opposition to gay marriage, it's probably not that strong because if it was a bedrock type principal he'd dig in with the veto and not look to the referendum. But I don't think he's just pretending or anything in order to preserve his shot at the GOP nomination in 4-8 years. From all publicly available information, him being somewhat opposed to gay marriage but not so opposed to it that he wasn't willing to let it come into being if the people passed a referendum in favor of it seems like it's pretty close to his real life preferences.<br /><br />I dunno. I think a lot of us interact almost exclusively with people (in real life and on the web) on a day to day basis who think gay marriage should be legal so it's hard to imagine someone who is well educated and smart being legitimately opposed to it. The fact that our president is fake anti gay marriage probably lends a lot to the idea that people who say they are against gay marriage are just pretending. But votes banning it are 28 for 28. In real life people are opposed to it. The sample of people that many of us are friends with or work with isn't particularly representative of America.</div>

			<div class="content">If you're saying that a poll that shows, for example, 52-48 in favor of gay marriage does not indicate a ballot would pass, I can agree with that. But you don't think the polls are showing an increasing acceptance of gay marriage?<br /><br />Are you instead saying that the increase is only due to... people thinking that's what the pollsters want to hear? That seems weird and not reflective of what's going on in society.</div>

			<div class="content">The idea of putting up minority rights to a vote is indeed problematic. But so is the idea of relying on courts to protect those rights.  While Brown v. Board of Ed. established the Supreme Court and other courts as willing protectors of minority rights, prior to the 1950s courts did very little and in fact often worked in the opposite direction. Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson are the obvious examples. <br /><br />I think progressives have become over-reliant on courts, and this has held progressive politics back, emphasizing legal strategies rather than making claims based on justice. Again, looking at civil rights--the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act are pieces of legislation that are the most important element of civil rights protections, and reflect a national commitment to those rights. <br /><br />By contrast, many see Roe v. Wade as subverting the progress states were making in establishing access to abortion. So now we're one vote away from reversing it and returning back to the way things were in the 1970s. Thus, a Supreme Court decision may work quickly, but is much less endurable than you might think. Rights are only secure if there is ultimately some consensus about it. <br /><br />To be sure, little of this has much to do with NJ, as I understand it. However, would be hugely significant if NJ, through a referendum, voted in favor of gay marriage. Much more significant than a court decision, and even more important than a legislative decision. This could be a huge opportunity that should be seized by supporters of equity.</div>

A million of that total came from just four people. Sixty-one percent of Walker’s contributions came from out of state. <br /><br />But Walker has also been spending money — more money than he raised. In the same five weeks, the governor spent $4.9 million, a large chunk of it on TV and radio ads and direct mail solicitations. The unlimited funds must be spent before the recall is official (unless used for legal challenges).<br />...<br /><br />Regardless of the reasoning, Walker’s spending speaks to the fact that a) he knows the challenge a recall will pose to him and b) he will be no easy victory for Democrats.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />idk idk, don't think you can say anything definitively right now</div>

That said, even a survey yields a plausible answer. I think the onslaught of debates are just killing the potential of any prospective candidate. The lack of insight and thinking demanded by the attack process seems to hinder the decision making in general. Although I do not like any of the GOP candidates, it would be beneficial if they could offer some explanations rather then just defend themselves, which they seem to do poorly, as I cannot tell if any of these characters would be a competent president nor can I decipher what there mythical plans are other then a highly guarded secret that cannot be exposed for fear of an attack.</div>

			<div class="content">What I'm saying is the winning the battle of gay marriage in the legislatures and the voting booth is a much, much bigger victory than winning in the courts. In a more general sense, progressives (in my opinion) would have much more success long term if they focused on public discourse and debate rather than legal strategies. <br /><br />Also, the Supreme Court taking a progressive opinion at odds with the majority is a relatively recent phenomenon. Historically, the SC has been regressive, not progressive. Really, it's been pretty regressive over the last 10-15 years anyway.</div>

He can either keep it from happening by himself or put it up to a vote to see whether the state's voters want it to happen. Is vetoing the bill un-American? I'm not really sure why the latter would be worse than the former.<br /><br />I personally think the comparisons to the fight against Jim Crow (or slavery) are mostly ridiculous and weaken the case for gay marriage. It's not denying service (or the right to vote, etc.) to someone based on the color of their skin. There are significant, relevant biological differences between men and women. Men and women get married and procreate and raise children and keep the human race going. Defining marriage as being between one man and one woman wasn't some arbitrary distinction founded in bigotry. <br /><br />I don't know if I think it's a civil right. I think it would be good public policy, increasing acceptance and tolerance and letting people live their lives they way they want to without doing harm to the institution of marriage, but right is kind of a big word. I don't know if this climbs to that level. Good things don't all have to be rights.</div>
