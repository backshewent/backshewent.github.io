But the bottom line is that the guy was questioned by a specialised interrogation team before being read his rights, and according to that memo, that info can (and was) used in court against him (in so far as in addition to the bombing, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/25/boston-bomb-suspects-new-york-city-attack" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">he's also been charged with a plot to do more damage in new york</a>).  <br /><br />On the basis of what I've seen so far, there's little doubt that this guy is the bomber. But if the wrong person is in the frame, then they're going to be hit hard with interrogation and likely fess up to something they didn't do.  Then get charged with it in court.  And I'm not hypothesising here, because this happened with at least 17 people in similar situations in the UK (that's the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, and the Maguire Seven for reference).  It will happen.  It's not good.  Greenwald and the ALCU are right to make noise about it, not least because history has shown that these increased powers do not prevent terrorist activity.  The UK ran the whole gamut of this in the 70s: detention without charge, Diplock courts (losing the right to trial by jury), internment on the basis of being SUSPECTED of being a member of a terrorist organisation. And yet the IRA were still operationally capable enough to nearly kill Thatcher in the Brighton Hotel Bombing of 1984. And that's just the UK and Northern Ireland. Ask Putin how his problems with the Chechens are getting on after over what, 15 years of throwing the kitchen sink at them?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I thought my days of being left of pacino were long gone (if this can be cast as a left/right issue) but I think Wiz is right on the money here. You either have faith in your justice system  or you don't, and if you start casting it out when things are really, really important then you're headed down a slippery slope. If you think the suspect has too many rights, well, revisit the issue and cast it into law. Equal protection means equal protection, it's pretty clear. And whether or not you &quot;Mirandize&quot; someone shouldn't mean a hoot, you have these rights or you don't, or they aren't actually rights. I hope every citizen knows them and can invoke them- I trust most do and knows they don't have to be called into being by pronouncing magic words or can disappear as long as the imp's name remains a secret.That's not to say THIS suspect was mistreated in any way, and the assertions of extra-judicial interrogation may have been in fact more political appeasement then any necessary or even out of the ordinary measures. But the fact that this appeasement works and that it's almost unanimous that some sort of treatment outside the law was necessary in this case is frightening in itself, since it speaks to a basic distrust of our legal institutions. And if it becomes accepted (or more accepted, since it already is by many) it will certainly result in innocent people being caught up, as well as engendering a disrespect for constitutional procedures that will inevitably corrupt a case and let the guilty go free.</div></blockquote><br />the idea of him being charged with musings about an alleged plot in NYC is very worrisome.</div>

In this case, it's not a huge deal since it doesn't appear like he's a part of a cell, but in future cases, the more they talk to us the better.

But the bottom line is that the guy was questioned by a specialised interrogation team before being read his rights, and according to that memo, that info can (and was) used in court against him (in so far as in addition to the bombing, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/25/boston-bomb-suspects-new-york-city-attack" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">he's also been charged with a plot to do more damage in new york</a>).  <br /><br />On the basis of what I've seen so far, there's little doubt that this guy is the bomber. But if the wrong person is in the frame, then they're going to be hit hard with interrogation and likely fess up to something they didn't do.  Then get charged with it in court.  And I'm not hypothesising here, because this happened with at least 17 people in similar situations in the UK (that's the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, and the Maguire Seven for reference).  It will happen.  It's not good.  Greenwald and the ALCU are right to make noise about it, not least because history has shown that these increased powers do not prevent terrorist activity.  The UK ran the whole gamut of this in the 70s: detention without charge, Diplock courts (losing the right to trial by jury), internment on the basis of being SUSPECTED of being a member of a terrorist organisation. And yet the IRA were still operationally capable enough to nearly kill Thatcher in the Brighton Hotel Bombing of 1984. And that's just the UK and Northern Ireland. Ask Putin how his problems with the Chechens are getting on after over what, 15 years of throwing the kitchen sink at them?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I thought my days of being left of pacino were long gone (if this can be cast as a left/right issue) but I think Wiz is right on the money here. You either have faith in your justice system  or you don't, and if you start casting it out when things are really, really important then you're headed down a slippery slope. If you think the suspect has too many rights, well, revisit the issue and cast it into law. Equal protection means equal protection, it's pretty clear. And whether or not you &quot;Mirandize&quot; someone shouldn't mean a hoot, you have these rights or you don't, or they aren't actually rights. I hope every citizen knows them and can invoke them- I trust most do and knows they don't have to be called into being by pronouncing magic words or can disappear as long as the imp's name remains a secret.That's not to say THIS suspect was mistreated in any way, and the assertions of extra-judicial interrogation may have been in fact more political appeasement then any necessary or even out of the ordinary measures. But the fact that this appeasement works and that it's almost unanimous that some sort of treatment outside the law was necessary in this case is frightening in itself, since it speaks to a basic distrust of our legal institutions. And if it becomes accepted (or more accepted, since it already is by many) it will certainly result in innocent people being caught up, as well as engendering a disrespect for constitutional procedures that will inevitably corrupt a case and let the guilty go free.</div></blockquote><br />the idea of him being charged with musings about an alleged plot in NYC is very worrisome.</div></blockquote><br />Did this happen?<br /><br />If a court decides he made the statement voluntarily, then his confession will be admissible. If they think he was coerced or otherwise questioned inappropriately, it won't be since he had not yet been Mirandized.</div>

			<div class="content">I've always wondered around that topic...at what point does your *intent* to commit a crime become an actual infraction?<br /><br />I always think of the story of the guy who was pulled over because he had his right turn signal on approaching a no-right-turn intersection.  The cop tried to cite him, but he pointed out that he never actually did turn, because the cop stopped him first.<br /><br />Is that what a &quot;conspiracy to commit&quot; charge is all about??</div>

But if the wrong person is in the frame, then they're going to be hit hard with interrogation and likely fess up to something they didn't do.  Then get charged with it in court.  And I'm not hypothesising here, because this happened with at least 17 people in similar situations in the UK (that's the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, and the Maguire Seven for reference).  It will happen.  It's not good.  Greenwald and the ALCU are right to make noise about it, not least because history has shown that these increased powers do not prevent terrorist activity.  The UK ran the whole gamut of this in the 70s: detention without charge, Diplock courts (losing the right to trial by jury), internment on the basis of being SUSPECTED of being a member of a terrorist organisation. And yet the IRA were still operationally capable enough to nearly kill Thatcher in the Brighton Hotel Bombing of 1984. And that's just the UK and Northern Ireland. Ask Putin how his problems with the Chechens are getting on after over what, 15 years of throwing the kitchen sink at them?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I thought my days of being left of pacino were long gone (if this can be cast as a left/right issue) but I think Wiz is right on the money here. You either have faith in your justice system  or you don't, and if you start casting it out when things are really, really important then you're headed down a slippery slope. If you think the suspect has too many rights, well, revisit the issue and cast it into law. Equal protection means equal protection, it's pretty clear. And whether or not you &quot;Mirandize&quot; someone shouldn't mean a hoot, you have these rights or you don't, or they aren't actually rights. I hope every citizen knows them and can invoke them- I trust most do and knows they don't have to be called into being by pronouncing magic words or can disappear as long as the imp's name remains a secret.That's not to say THIS suspect was mistreated in any way, and the assertions of extra-judicial interrogation may have been in fact more political appeasement then any necessary or even out of the ordinary measures. But the fact that this appeasement works and that it's almost unanimous that some sort of treatment outside the law was necessary in this case is frightening in itself, since it speaks to a basic distrust of our legal institutions. And if it becomes accepted (or more accepted, since it already is by many) it will certainly result in innocent people being caught up, as well as engendering a disrespect for constitutional procedures that will inevitably corrupt a case and let the guilty go free.</div></blockquote><br />the idea of him being charged with musings about an alleged plot in NYC is very worrisome.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, that's a distinction I want to make. I don't have any problem with this case, per se. I mean, who the hell cares if they charge him with an alleged plot in NYC, and why would you bother? These guys are as near to certainly guilty as one can be certain without having stuffed the pressure cookers in their living room with them, and guilty of an absolutely horrendous act deserving of the greatest punishment allowable. And there may very well have existed possible continuing threats even after the death and arrest of these suspects, though I still don't see that the &quot;special exception&quot; brought into play can or should have resulted in unearthing information regarding this. But each time this treatment is used it becomes more a part of common practice and wears down any resistance or need to justify it. It's honestly a useless argument in these circumstances (or this thread for that matter)since it's impossible to view these practices objectively under the appearance of imminent danger. However, under calmer circumstances they of course won't be revisited.</div>

Maybe we do ally ourselves with peaceful nations, but that isn't making the world more peaceful. And if it were, I doubt it'd be because of our current efforts to make it so.</div></blockquote><br /><br />if we did not get involved internationally in the affairs of other nations and let countries do whatever they wanted, the world would be far less civil. the threat of action by the US, either militarily or economically, is a big deterrent for most countries. most. you can argue that china has as big of an influence as the US, but theres is more economic, because of their buying power (of debt)<br /><br />i find it really difficult to imagine a scenario in which the US becomes non-interventional around the world. the US tried to be a non-interventional entity after World War I, and you saw how well that worked out. now i think we feel obligated to be completely and totally involved, for better or worse. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>tell that to the people of a number of latin american and middle eastern countries who suffered 'leadership' by gents who happened to put our interests above theirs.</div></blockquote><br /><br />i never said it is always &quot;right&quot; and its pretty obvious to anyone with an understanding of the history of the CIA that we meddle in foreign affairs when we worry that the regime in charge, or the regime trying to take charge, builds their platform on ideals that go against what the US is striving for. thats why I said<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>the US does a lot of shit in secret that no one will ever know about, that creates disharmony and discord all over the world. we do it to try and weed out people we can't control, and the reason we do this is because we want everyone to behave and be peaceful</div></blockquote><br /><br />we want people to behave and not cause trouble, because trouble costs more to police. is that catering to our own self interests too? yes. is it wrong? yes. is it reality? yes.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>this is, um, overbroad. It lacks nuance. It would lack nuance if asserted by a 10th grader.</div></blockquote><br /><br />its simplistic and isn't nuanced, because the nuanced response is 100,000 words in length, and something i dont have time to write.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>Consider that we share the sacrifice; our war dead were too numerous in Iran, but count up the numbers of Iranian dead and get back to me about sacrifice.</div></blockquote><br /><br />i never said our sacrifice was greater than anyone else's. i said that we sacrifice. we've sacrificed innocent men and women, and we've sacrificed potential alliances because of our stances around the world. obviously a lot of innocent people have died at the hands of the US government too. i never denied any of that.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>drsmooth wrote:</cite>Any halfway competent pr hack will tell you the 1st thing you have to do in a &quot;good&quot; PR campaign is walk the walk. You can't just finesse the verbiage. You have to do things differently - perhaps especially in the 21st century.</div></blockquote><br /><br />sure. but i think even when we do &quot;the right thing&quot; we often do not know how to present it as such. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Wizlah wrote:</cite>America polices the parts of the world of strategic interest to America. Please tell me the last time you stuck your nose in Africa to keep the peace there.</div></blockquote><br /><br />id argue we tried, we saw the consequences, and we've backed away. and obviously part of that is economically driven.<br /><br />everyone can attack me, as if im presenting my own personal views and endorsing how we act abroad. im just explaining why i think we act the way we do. we obviously depend on the rest of the world to build stuff for us to buy, and to buy the stuff that we build and export. for the US economy to function properly, we need other countries to behave and do business with us. if they don't, it closes potential markets. our actions around the world benefit our own self-interest, but often times, those self-interests dovetail with many other peaceful nations as well. im not saying its perfect, or right even, im just saying it is how it is.</div>
