<br />
<br />If you're talking about admitting students without funding, it's probably pretty common in the humanities and social sciences. But I think lots of programs see grad students as sources of really cheap labor, and in fact probably fund more students with TAs than they should. (For instance, consider a random SEC school other than Vanderbilt--they've all got a bunch of TAs teaching Freshman comp--how many of these people get tenure track positions?) That is, too many people are enrolling in PhD programs given the realities of the academic job market.</div>

<br />
<br />This.  I work for the union of graduate teaching assistants and research assistants at Temple.  We make a pittance, and we do get health insurance - but only because we unionized.  No health insurance before the union formed, in 2002.
<br />
<br />Say jerz, the TAs/RAs are unionized at Rutgers.  I've been meaning to talk to you about that.  I'm sure you are not a union guy, but if there is anyplace a union is needed, it's for grad students who make bupkiss.  Rutgers grad students are unionized in with the faculty, and have been since 1976, so they have a pretty decent package in terms of salary at this point.  You should join.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm not familiar with most of my great-aunts or great-uncles, but my 85-yr old grandmother on my father's side had only one sister remaining, and this sister had been sick and in a nursing home for a while.  This past weekend my grandmother tells my dad that when she went to sleep and rolled over in her bed, she saw an image of the 30-yr old version of her sister laying in bed next to her for a few minutes.  
<br />
<br />The next morning, the sister died...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />While the death of my grandfather almost 4 yrs ago still saddens her, my grandmom was at peace and back to watching Phils/Mets like nothing happened.  (btw she can't stand Lidge either...ha)
<br />
<br />This ish doesn't really happen, does it?</div>

<br />i'm on the corner of my cul-de-sac and my garage/driveway are on buyers road while the front of my house (my proper address) is on brewster, so i routinely get pizzas/chinese mistakenly delivered to my house for the guy down the street b/c they think my house is on buyers.  it's funny what a rush those guys are in - they're thrusting the food into my hands as soon as i open the door before i even have a chance to tell them that they have the wrong house.  one of these days, i'm going to be hungry enough to take the delivery...i wonder what happens when they do this when i'm not home to tell them where to go, even when i tell them to their faces it's for the next house down and point to it, most of the guys stare at me like i'm speaking japanese.</div>

<br />
<br />This happened to me too.  I worked with this movie nerd who took a bunch of us downtown to see this movie about the IRA.  None of us had any idea (this was long before the movie had any word of mouth).  It was both shocking and hilarious.</div>

<br />
<br />I would think that this is your stumbling block to getting it cashed.  You both have to endorse it, and your bank is most likely going to want to see your marriage certificate to change the name on your account.
<br />
<br />(It's cute that they made the check out that way, but for convenience sakes, it's majorly annoying for you.)
<br />
<br />After BabyVox was born, Vox's grandmother started making checks out to the both boys in their names instead of to Vox/me or giving cash.  It took me months to get all the paperwork together and get to the bank to open accounts for them.</div>
