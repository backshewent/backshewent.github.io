			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>FTN wrote:</cite>Back to criticizing the Palin pick. Its a few days old, but I just read it anyway<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Americans have an unhealthy desire to see average people promoted to positions of great authority. No one wants an average neurosurgeon or even an average carpenter, but when it comes time to vest a man or woman with more power and responsibility than any person has held in human history, Americans say they want a regular guy, someone just like themselves. President Bush kept his edge on the &quot;Who would you like to have a beer with?&quot; poll question in 2004, and won reelection.<br /><br />This is one of the many points at which narcissism becomes indistinguishable from masochism. Let me put it plainly: If you want someone just like you to be president of the United States, or even vice president, you deserve whatever dysfunctional society you get. You deserve to be poor, to see the environment despoiled, to watch your children receive a fourth-rate education and to suffer as this country wages -- and loses -- both necessary and unnecessary wars.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-harris3-2008sep03,0,5745350.story" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Sam Harris = not a fan of Palin</a>, but this part of the article is kind of amusing.</div></blockquote>
<br />You really can't liken Bush to Palin. Bush grew up in a wealthy household, the son and grandson of political insiders. He went to exclusive private schools, Yale, and Harvard. He was handed business opportunity after business opportunity. While he probably is someone we'd want to have a beer with few can identify with his life. He may be of average ability but not an average background.
<br />
<br />Palin's background is so compelling because it is so average. She's the daughter of average folks. Her husband is a working man. She didn't go to a fancy college. She was mayor of a small town and worked hard to get elected governor. Does she have average ability or intelligence? Too soon to tell, but some people rave about her ability. She is not just like you in skill. The only thing that Bush and Palin have in common is that they are likable.</div>

			<div class="content">According to <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/157986" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">Newsweek</a>, a number of the Palin &quot;stories&quot;, including those about book banning and creationism, were false or exaggerated.   Apparently someone with an axe to grind went as far as cutting and pasting items to create false information, and the media was happy to run with it.  One of the more obvious errors was the inclusion of Harry Potter books on Palin's banned list - books that didn't exist when the list was supposedly supplied.
<br />
<br />Regarding the &quot;God's will&quot; stuff from Palin, I get the sense that she doesn't see things as a plan and that she's been given marching orders.  My impression is that she hopes there is a plan, and if things work out, then God wanted it to work out that way, if they don't, then he didn't.  
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for -- that there is a plan, and that plan is God's plan.&quot;</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The above was really a more religous way of saying let's hope we're doing the right thing.  It wasn't saying that God sent us on a mission.
<br />
<br />Is she influenced by her faith? Sure, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.  It seems to me that she's really talking about literately praying that she makes the right decisions.</div>

<br />
<br />So you're saying that if a child wants to bring up intelligent design (which I don't believe in), then they should be ignored, and not have an intelligent discussion around the issue?  Sounds like a school I want my kid to learn in.  Don't question anything, just regurgitate what the teacher tells you.  You fail to mention that she said she doesn't want it as part of the curriculum.
<br />
<br />And the what-if statement doesn't provide any context whatsoever, so how would you know what question was actually posed?  Her question could have been &quot;What if books were banned by another party (court, whatever)- could we fight the judgement?&quot;  or it could have been &quot;What if I give you a list of books, can we ban them?&quot;.  The article doesn't say.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will speak at her son’s Army deployment ceremony on 9/11 and spend two days with ABC News crews later this week as part of a McCain campaign plan to increase Americans’ comfort with her as a leader.<br /><br />Campaign and network officials had said on Sunday that her first television interview would be a sit-down with Charles Gibson of ABC’s “World News.”<br /><br />But it turns out that she is spending much of Thursday and Friday with Gibson — at the ceremony in Fairbanks, Alaska, and at her home in Wasilla, Alaska.<br /><br />Campaign aides said the anchorman will get extensive, repeated access to Palin throughout her first trip home since becoming the nominee.<br /><br />“ABC News will have plenty of time to question her and examine her and spend time with her,” a campaign official said. “They’ll do multiple interviews over two days. No topics are off-limits – there are no ground rules. There’s tons of time to talk to her about every topic.”<br /><br />The remarkable rollout reflects new confidence in Palin by her handlers, who initially had suggested it would be a while before she did interviews. Now, there will be several.</div></blockquote>

			<div class="content">Learning is not about memorization.  Especially in science, it's about taking information, processing it, challenging it, moving it forward.  There is no reason why someone couldn't discuss that in a classroom, and allow the teacher to debate it with them.  Why stifle the debate?  What are people afraid of?  It's not a validation, it's an opportunity for the teacher to progress the student's thinking, poke holes in the intelligent design argument.
<br />
<br />I remember sitting in a meeting with room full of PhD's a number of years ago, right after the Dolly cloning announcement was made.  One of docs was so sure it was untrue (and most of them didn't believe it), he swore he'd &quot;eat his hat&quot; if she were a clone.  When Jurassic Park came out, there were many articles debunking the possibility, claiming it would never happen.  So much for goofy science/science fiction. 
<br />
<br />It's that kind of thinking that prevents innovation.  Even if someone is wrong, why do we want to silence them?</div>

			<div class="content">For crying out loud how is this even a discussion?
<br />
<br />&quot;Intelligent design&quot; cannot be taught in science classes because it is not founded upon scientific principles.  If some concerned student wants to discuss &quot;alternatives&quot; to the thoroughly tested and scrutinized theory of evolution that involve magic fairy dust or the invisible cloud guy, let him do it in a Comparative Religions or Social Studies class.  Or send her to a parochial school.  Otherwise, go screw.
<br />
<br />We wonder why we're falling behind other nations in the world in our students' academic achievement in science and math when we've been consumed by this idiotic non-discussion.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>cshort wrote:</cite>Learning is not about memorization.  Especially in science, it's about taking information, processing it, challenging it, moving it forward.  There is no reason why someone couldn't discuss that in a classroom, and allow the teacher to debate it with them.  Why stifle the debate?  What are people afraid of?  It's not a validation, it's an opportunity for the teacher to progress the student's thinking, poke holes in the intelligent design argument.<br /><br />I remember sitting in a meeting with room full of PhD's a number of years ago, right after the Dolly cloning announcement was made.  One of docs was so sure it was untrue (and most of them didn't believe it), he swore he'd &quot;eat his hat&quot; if she were a clone.  When Jurassic Park came out, there were many articles debunking the possibility, claiming it would never happen.  So much for goofy science/science fiction. <br /><br />It's that kind of thinking that prevents innovation.  Even if someone is wrong, why do we want to silence them?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />The left is largely responsible for this--but in the end, the only defense of of creationist/intelligent design claptrap is relativism--all ideas are equally good. 
<br />
<br />The reason you don't teach that junk in a science class is because based on any reasonable definition of science, it doesn't count. Lots of whack jobs believe in astrology and tarot cards. I don't think those things should be offered in science class either.</div>

			<div class="content">Washington, D.C. -- The media has played a significant role in convincing Americans that offshore drilling for oil in the United States could significantly lower the price of gasoline, according to an analysis released today by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Even though the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency has stated that the benefits from such drilling would be too small to have any significant effect on oil prices, the media has overwhelmingly conveyed the impression that it could. Media coverage of the issue may have influenced public opinion, with a majority now favoring expanded drilling, as proposed by presidential candidate John McCain.

<br />
<br />What are you talking about?  I already said that I didn't care about nor do I believe in unbiased journalism.  I said at the outset we should just drop that schtick and go with the swelling flow: let people choose what they want.  The only people concerned with this are the folks who have a vested interest in having their opinion heard as the unbiased one.  
<br />
<br />I don't think pick your own POV is the best way, it's just the way things are going anyway so just go there.  Then you can eliminate all the BS about liberal or conservative bias - it is what it is.  
<br />
<br />Then when Alex Jones gets a TV show you can watch it all day.</div>
