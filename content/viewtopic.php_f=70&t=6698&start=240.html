<br />
<br />Unless the environment changed from the environment of evolutionary adaptedness for furnaces.  Perhaps in the evolutionary past there were certain furnaces who were able to out-reproduce other furnaces and their offspring (space heaters) were also able to reproduce very successfully once they grew up to be furnaces.  But then there was a shift in the environmental conditions and those furnaces formerly very successful at reproducing and producing successfully reproducing space heaters were unable to find enough fuel to burn in the furnace or the outlets all had child safety caps and the space heaters had no opposable thumbs and they all died before growing up to reproductive maturity.  Then the analogy is air tight.</div>

<br />
<br />A huge part of the problem, one rarely discussed, is teacher training. Education majors takes most of their hours in education courses, rather than in the subject matter they're supposed to be teaching. Now, some of this makes sense--knowing how to read and teaching someone else how to read are different things. But the balance is out of whack.
<br />
<br />Second, related to the first, is that what passes for scholarship in education (that is, the kinds of things university education researchers do) would simply not pass muster in other fields. Research methodologies and statistics are laughably bad, and yet it is on that basis that curricula are developed and implemented. It's like Joe Morgan v. Billy Beane. 
<br />
<br />So called education professionals (not school teachers, but the higher education superstructure and the various accrediting and credentialing agencies) spend an enormous amount of time generating documents. There is an amazingly pervasive paperwork fetish, and this creates a horrible demand on actual in the classroom teachers as well.</div>

<br />
<br />Right. 
<br />
<br />Rather than read Genesis as an account of creation (since really, very little of Genesis actually discusses that, and it does so in extremely general terms) it makes more sense to read as a theodicy where evil is explained as a consequence of free will. The interesting part of the story isn't that there is a garden of eden, but that there's that pesky tree of knowledge there.</div>

And that Randi Weingarten, whom I really can't stand, doesn't support what Rhee is doing, makes me all the more disposed to believe she's on the right track. <br /><br />What Weingarten knows, but won't say, is that &quot;rookies who will work their hearts and souls out for a few years and then burn out” describes HALF of New York City teachers right now; 50 percent of new teachers leave after three years, either for easier gigs in the 'burbs or out of the profession altogether. That isn't all about money, and the reformers need to figure out how to better support young teachers--not assigning them to the worst schools might help--but a greater financial reward would seem like part of the answer. <br /><br />To get back to your original contention, &quot;professionalize the teaching profession&quot; would seem to be a winning strategy on education, for either party. But the Dems almost certainly aren't brave enough to take on the Weingartens of the world, and the Republicans can't or won't get beyond their traditional destructionist impulses (from &quot;close the Dept of Ed&quot; to &quot;privatize it all&quot;) in this area.</div></blockquote><br /><br />A huge part of the problem, one rarely discussed, is teacher training.

<br />
<br />We're trying to implement something like that here, but the education people are somewhat obstructionist. However, that issue is above my pay grade. I think the deal is if you want to teach, you take a 5th year and get a masters in teaching.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>The Dude wrote:</cite>LA, you know very well that creationism involves the deity creating humanity as well, takes the book of genesis literally</div></blockquote><br />I always enjoy how you <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> what I'm thinking better than I do. And no, I don't know that. Because I believe in creationism but don't believe in taking the Book of Genesis literally. But you really missed my point. People criticize Palin for being a creationist when they've decided to take their definition and apply it to her. Does she believe that every word in the Bible is literally true? Despite the assurances from most people here, I've never heard her say she did. I Googled and I can't find any quote from her saying it is. I do know that the pastor of her church has said it is, but I'd like to think that we can't assume that all the congregants in a church believe what the pastor believes, now can we? <br /><br />I believe in the story of Genesis. How much of it is figurative and how much is literal is something that I've made my own judgement. I don't tell other people how they should interpret the Bible. I have no idea how Sarah Palin does. But what if she believes in the Bible being literal? How does that impact anyone else? The belief is that because she believes that  she's &quot;judgmental and dictatorial, telling people how they’ve got to live their lives.&quot; This judgement doesn't come from anything Palin has said or done but people assigning beliefs to her. If you actually look at her record you'll find that her personal beliefs have played little or no part in how she's governed. <br /><br />This all stems from answers Palin gave in a 2006 debate. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Teach both. You know, don’t be afraid of education. Healthy debate is so important, and it’s so valuable in our schools. I am a proponent of teaching both.<br /><br />I don’t think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class. I’m not going to pretend I know how all this came to be.</div></blockquote>
<br />Oh, how horrible. What is her definition of intelligent design that should be taught in schools? I have no idea and since she hasn't pushed for it as governor it isn't likely that I will. I do know that many view Darwin as dismissing religion and I can see how that would get them rankled. Of course she proposes some of those other radical Christian right ideas like healthy debate and that we really don't know how this all came to be. 
<br />
<br />Some people on the right make moral judgements about others. They believe they are morally superior and that views that disagree with theirs have no merit. The left is no better. They believe they are intellectually superior to everyone else and that views that disagree with theirs also have no merit, and apparently with some, disqualify anyone who has them for all but manual labor. 
<br />
<br />As a social libertarian I believe that anyone can believe or do whatever they want as long as it doesn't impact others. I don't think that makes me better than anyone else. In fact, it's my core belief that everyone's beliefs have equal value. Yes, even those that are insane. I have no litmus test on what a person has to think when choosing a candidate. I only care about what they'll do. Based on Palin's record in public office I don't see how she's pushing her social agenda, if she has one, on anyone.</div>

<br />Of course not everyone in a Party thinks the same way, but pro-life Democrats aren't well liked in the Democratic Party. Any more than pro-choice Republicans are liked. 
<br />
<br />Four people, a Republican, a centerist Democrat, and two independents, have told me they couldn't vote for McCain because Palin is pro-life. Social issues are evergreen issues for both parties, not just the Republicans. When it comes to fiscal and foreign policy both parties can succeed or fail. If your party's philosophy provides failures in these areas you know that social issues never will. If a Democrat is a failure he can at least tell the electorate that his Republican opponent wants to control your body and eliminate the right of abortion. He'll get votes he might not get on fiscal and foreign policy issues.</div>
