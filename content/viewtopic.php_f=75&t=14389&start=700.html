			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>pacino wrote:</cite>you are correct, but the corresponding bump did not erase the deficit, and the volatile bear/bull market over the past 15-20 years created some artifical gains anyway. this is all i'm saying...no one can 'game' the market and figure it out. hell, it doesnt seem banks whose livelihoods are becoming further entwined in it seem to have figured it out, why do we think joe schmo will?<br /></div></blockquote><br />The health of one's pension is dependent upon the discipline of those funding/managing it, just like the health of a 401k account is dependent on the health o those managing it. While I agree that improved financial education should probably be combined with widespread use of 401k instruments, I'd rather be the one in charge of my financial future. We're having so many problems with the underfunding of pensions that it's clear that this model is not working. And the reason is simple: the math doesnt add up. It doesnt matter if it's privately funded or funded by your employer; one must put a lot of money of way per year if one is to expect that 30 years of work will fund 30+ years of retirement and health care. The fact that the auto workers had previously successfully negotiated for unsustainable pension plans (that the companies could not affford) does mean that pension plans are clearly superior to 401k plans.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Werthless wrote:</cite>There are ways to become a teacher, or an artist, or to follow any other career path that has a low expected income without going $160,000 into debt. That's my argument. If you don't think this is true, that it's not possible to go leverage some combination of [community college, state schools, merit scholarships, need based grants, etc] to prevent $160,000 in loans from accruing, then I don't want you teaching my kid anyway.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, you're right, $160K in debt is not necessary to these careers.  I kind of think it is bad, though, that we set up our whole society to revere places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc., and then demand one of two things of those who are admitted: (1) Be rich enough to pay for it in cash or (2) Only go there if you are going to convert that degree into a high-paying job.  So, if I am a kid from a modest home, one not so poor I qualify for aid but not so rich my family can put me through a $50K+/year school, and I apply to Harvard, and get in - a dream come true for any academically-minded kid - I'd better either take an engineering or science degree or turn them down.  If I want to study the classics and go on to teach them, I am SOL.<br /><br />What makes this really bad is that it's not like I can expect to go to Middle Wyoming State to take a degree in the Classics, and then get into Harvard grad school with a funded line.  Where you went to undergrad has a lot to do with what grad schools you can get into.</div>

Wouldn't your prospects out of college only be marginally better than someone with a teaching degree?</div></blockquote><br />My prospects were good, both when I entered college as a biology major and left it with an economics degree with political economy and finance minors. I did not have to borrow the full amount, and likely would have chosen a different school if I had been forced to. I qualified for need-based aid in a mix of grants and loans, so my loan payments are very reasonable.</div></blockquote><br />I have 18k per year in grants and scholarships. I'm still going to end up 100-110k in debt for my political science degree.  I could have probably ended up saving 20-30 grand going to a state school but I think I benefited educationally and socially going to a smaller university. <br /><br />I guess I take exception with the idea that I shouldn't educate myself because my parents make just enough money to not qualify for a lot of need based aid while also not having the ability to pay my tuition.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Also, Werthless's idea essentially means that anyone interested in teaching pretty much anything will have to come from substantial means.  No more teachers who come from the working classes; only those from priviliged backgrounds need apply.<br /><br />That's a great way to reduce the quality of teaching.</div></blockquote><br />There are ways to become a teacher, or an artist, or to follow any other career path that has a low expected income without going $160,000 into debt.

That's my argument. If you don't think this is true, that it's not possible to go leverage some combination of [community college, state schools, merit scholarships, need based grants, etc] to prevent $160,000 in loans from accruing, then I don't want you teaching my kid anyway.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, you're right, $160K in debt is not necessary to these careers.  I kind of think it is bad, though, that we set up our whole society to revere places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc., and then demand one of two things of those who are admitted: (1) Be rich enough to pay for it in cash or (2) Only go there if you are going to convert that degree into a high-paying job.  So, if I am a kid from a modest home, one not so poor I qualify for aid but not so rich my family can put me through a $50K+/year school, and I apply to Harvard, and get in - a dream come true for any academically-minded kid - I'd better either take an engineering or science degree or turn them down.  If I want to study the classics and go on to teach them, I am SOL.</div></blockquote><br />Harvard, Yale, etc are in a different place than other second-tier elite colleges without the endowment to provide generous grants. Harvard, in particular, has a generous aid program that they have worked to make public. From their website:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>No contribution is expected from parents with incomes under $65,000. Beginning with the class of 2016, those parents with annual incomes between $65,000 and $150,000 are asked to contribute from zero to ten percent of their income. Some families with incomes above $150,000 still qualify for aid. Families at all incomes who have significant assets will continue to pay more than those in less fortunate circumstances. Students are also asked to contribute to the cost of their education through term-time and summer work.</div></blockquote><br />No one is forced to decline Harvard because their family cannot afford it. Now, if your parents make $200,000/yr and don't want to pay for your college, that's a different story. <br /><br />It's private colleges without the endowment to fund generous grants, that are a gamble. Here's some free advice: you should not go to Bucknell to become a teacher if you must pay <a href="http://www.bucknell.edu/x17321.xml" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">$56,190</a> per year to attend (either in loans or your parents' cash). You should consider Temple, Penn State, or some school with scholarship opportunities.</div>

If you went to an elite undergrad, then a grad school is likely willing to tolerate a lower GPA. They may treat a Harvard applicant with a 3.3 GPA like a 3.8 applicant from Temple. <br /><br />There's no easy road to a grad program at Harvard. You need an impeccable resume. And while it's possible to go from Middle Wyoming State to Harvard, you must have other indicators of elite scholarship beyond a 4.0 GPA. And luck.</div>

To the extent your dad was/is still investing in equities it shouldn't have taken that large of a bite out of his 401k and the subsequent upturn in stocks should have mitigated the losses to a large extent if not erased them. Maybe that's just how it worked at my old place of employment.<br /><br />I didn't watch the 40 minute speech but I read your post and commented on the aspect of it which I found interesting.</div></blockquote><br />The stock half of my 401K took a pounding but has fully recovered.  If his Dad got creamed, likely he switched out of stocks near the bottom and didn't participate in what has been a very strong recovery.  If you had normal, relatively safe and diverse stock portfolio and made no changes since the crash, you really should be whole today.</div>

You can't arrest an American-citizen terrorist in the tribal areas of Yemen, Afghanistan, or Pakistan.  You can here in the US.  You don't get a badge of safety because you are an American citizen fighting against America in a war zone.  Yemen is most definitely a war zone.  You can also arrest a terrorist in Paris or London, so simply being overseas doesn't permit a drone strike against you.</div>
