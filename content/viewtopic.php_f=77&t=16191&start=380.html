If the purported spokesperson were prone to choking on snack foods, then maybe. The statements &quot;May have contributed to significant strategic errors?&quot;  Trash-talking an opponent in a soundbite is going to &quot;contribute to significant strategic errors&quot; in what very particular way? A lot - too much - has been made of the jayvee team remark, and the POTUS shouldn't have bothered trying to walk back whether he was talking about ISIS or not. Wood is confusing messaging for strategy, and given his experience, it's not because he doesn't understand the difference, but rather because doing so fits his narrative.<br /><br />I wanted to be eager to read this, but that kind of crap instead makes me eager to make fun of this guy's accent.<br /><br />I'm no fan of Team Obama's foreign policy, generally or specifically, but if you have a case to make, don't lead it with flimsy foreshadowing crap like this.</div>

If the purported spokesperson were prone to choking on snack foods, then maybe. The statements &quot;May have contributed to significant strategic errors?&quot;  Trash-talking an opponent in a soundbite is going to &quot;contribute to significant strategic errors&quot; in what very particular way? A lot - too much - has been made of the jayvee team remark, and the POTUS shouldn't have bothered trying to walk back whether he was talking about ISIS or not. Wood is confusing messaging for strategy, and given his experience, it's not because he doesn't understand the difference, but rather because doing so fits his narrative.<br /><br />I wanted to be eager to read this, but that kind of crap instead makes me eager to make fun of this guy's accent.<br /><br />I'm no fan of Team Obama's foreign policy, generally or specifically, but if you have a case to make, don't lead it with flimsy foreshadowing crap like this.</div></blockquote><br />I don't understand your complaint. It's not gratuitous horseshit or cherry-picking BS. It's the central thesis of his piece that ISIS's goals, motivations, methods, etc. are radically different than anything we've come across previously, including from Al Qaeda. The administration (or at least the president) viewing ISIS as Al Qaeda Lite was wrong in many different ways and reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors in confronting the challenges it presents.</div>

			<div class="content">While I'm still struggling to figure out what one can actually &quot;learn&quot; from Graeme Woods about ISIS, or effective strategy to confront ISIS, or the time of day in Istanbul, I am trying to tag sections of his article that provide examples of stuff you <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> learn much from. Here's one:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If we had identified the Islamic State’s intentions early, and realized that the vacuum in Syria and Iraq would give it ample space to carry them out, we might, at a minimum, have pushed Iraq to harden its border with Syria and preemptively make deals with its Sunnis. That would at least have avoided the electrifying propaganda effect created by the declaration of a caliphate just after the conquest of Iraq’s third-largest city. Yet, just over a year ago, Obama told The New Yorker that he considered ISIS to be al-Qaeda’s weaker partner. “If a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant,” the president said.</div></blockquote><br /><br />So, we might have pushed Iraq to harden its border with Syria - which they might not have done even if we had pushed;  and they might have tried making pre-emptive deals with its Sunnis - which might or might not have worked; and that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> have avoided the &quot;electrifying propaganda effect&quot; of the declaration of a caliphate - or it might not have.<br /><br />And Woods ends with what is essentially a repetition of the <span style="font-style: italic">non sequitur</span> about ISIS being a jayvee squad. Apparently the reader is supposed to conclude from Woods' insinuation that all of Woods' coulda/woulda/shoulda about potentially effective responses to ISIS, which we are apparently to treat as a collection of certainties, shows that Obama's dismissive reference proves the Administration does not sufficiently &quot;get&quot; ISIS.<br /><br />It does not prove that. At all. What are we learning from this? Nothing. At all.</div>

			<div class="content">Here's an example of Woods tail-chasing, presented as some kind of oracular strategic counsel. I've added a couple of explanatory remarks in brackets:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maqdisi [an al-Qaeda poohbah] gets mocked roundly on Twitter by the Islamic State’s fans, and al‑Qaeda is held in great contempt for refusing to acknowledge the caliphate. Cole Bunzel, a scholar who studies Islamic State ideology [a 3rd year PhD student of another authority Woods cites elsewhere in his artile], read Maqdisi’s opinion on Henning’s status and thought it would hasten his and other captives’ death. “If I were held captive by the Islamic State and Maqdisi said I shouldn’t be killed,” he told me, “I’d kiss my ass goodbye.”<br /><br />Kassig’s death was a tragedy, but the plan’s success would have been a bigger one. A reconciliation between Maqdisi and Binali would have begun to heal the main rift between the world’s two largest jihadist organizations. It’s possible that the government wanted only to draw out Binali for intelligence purposes or assassination. (Multiple attempts to elicit comment from the FBI were unsuccessful.) Regardless, the decision to play matchmaker for America’s two main terrorist antagonists reveals astonishingly poor judgment. [So bringing al-Queda and ISIS together is bad. Hold that thought....]<br /><br />....Some observers have called for escalation, including several predictable voices from the interventionist right (Max Boot, Frederick Kagan), who have urged the deployment of tens of thousands of American soldiers. These calls should not be dismissed too quickly: an avowedly genocidal organization is on its potential victims’ front lawn, and it is committing daily atrocities in the territory it already controls.<br /><br />One way to un-cast the Islamic State’s spell over its adherents would be to overpower it militarily and occupy the parts of Syria and Iraq now under caliphate rule. Al‑Qaeda is ineradicable because it can survive, cockroach-like, by going underground. The Islamic State cannot. If it loses its grip on its territory in Syria and Iraq, it will cease to be a caliphate. [So, despite Woods earlier concerns, no one can <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> &quot;match-make&quot; al Qaeda and ISIS, because they immediately confront a myriad of irreconcilable philosophical and operational differences. Hold that thought, again....] <br /><br />Caliphates cannot exist as underground movements, because territorial authority is a requirement: take away its command of territory, and all those oaths of allegiance are no longer binding. Former pledges could of course continue to attack the West and behead their enemies, as freelancers. But the propaganda value of the caliphate would disappear, and with it the supposed religious duty to immigrate and serve it. If the United States were to invade, the Islamic State’s obsession with battle at Dabiq suggests that it might send vast resources there, as if in a conventional battle. If the state musters at Dabiq in full force, only to be routed, it might never recover. [So boots on ISIS ground might be good. Hold <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> thought....]<br /><br />Abu Baraa, who maintains a YouTube channel about Islamic law, says the caliph, Baghdadi, cannot negotiate or recognize borders, and must continually make war, or he will remove himself from Islam.<br /><br />And yet the risks of escalation are enormous. The biggest proponent of an American invasion is the Islamic State itself. [So, boots on ISIS ground is probably very bad. Hold that -- oh fuck it, these aren't thoughts at all, are they?]</div></blockquote></div>

ISIS cannot survive in the form Al Qaeda has because its ideology requires it to hold territory and govern it. ISIS and Al Qaeda allying, working together, combining forces, whatever would not require ISIS to become an underground network of cells, so would not destroy ISIS. Al Qaeda's focus on large scale attacks in the US and Europe is not incompatible with the Islamic State, although this is not the current focus of ISIS. If the groups were to become friendly with each other, rather than feuding with each other, they could marry ISIS's strengths (fanatical adherents in Western countries) with Al Qaeda's goals (killing Westerners in eye catching ways in the West). This would be bad.<br /><br />- The author is making it pretty clear there is not some silver bullet solution to the current problem. There are scenarios he envisions where it might become necessary to put boots on the ground (protecting Erbil/the Kurds; busting up an ISIS/Al Qaeda alliance), but suggests in the current situation a ground invasion is likely to be a net negative. To me, these seem like thoughts.</div>

This would be bad.</div></blockquote><br />But your boy Woods' narrative - and especially the Kassig episode, as he relates it - demonstrate that their becoming friendly is really, really really unlikely.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>- The author is making it pretty clear there is not some silver bullet solution to the current problem. </div></blockquote> yeah, I guess I totally forgot the now-infamous  Lone Ranger speech in which Obama said something completely the opposite.  Probably because it hasn't happened.<br /><br />So what you have left is &quot;Obama is dangerously misunderestimating the ISIS threat!&quot; and &quot;caution in putting US troops on the ground vs ISIS is warranted&quot;, the first of which seems pretty plainly untrue and the 2nd of which is one of the main elements of Obama's approach. Together they make it seem as though Woods doesn't really have much new to say, but nonetheless goes ahead and says it at great length.</div>
