<br />To get you started. But yeah, I'm so duped whack fringest of the fringe. Or are you a horse with blinders on? As Jack Nicholson said so well &quot;you can't handle the truth&quot;. 
<br />
<br />[According to Lax, since I didn't see the molten steel, I didn't hear the pop pop pop, I'm not a structural engineer, I've never been to Bohemian Grove, nor a Skull and Bones secret society meeting -- I can't speak to it, or evaluate whether anyone else can speak to it. ]

			<div class="content">I don't care who tries to debunk anything I site. There's clearly enough questions and alternate analysis, to suggest to any reasonable person -- that things were quite different than the official account. It's like I said, the analogy is often 'religion'. There's very little anyone, reasonable, armed with facts, questions of import or evidence and logic -- that can convince someone to abandon their religious beliefs.
<br />
<br />I on the other-hand, remain anxious to hear all these voices claiming emphatically that the buildings were blown up -- to debate the other engineers, and producers of shows like Nova or the evening news, and decision makers who say what gets to be put on the air, the govt people and other decision makers who disappear key evidence, made decisions to confiscate cameras, -- all of them. Let's get a public debate from both sides and see where it nets out?
<br />
<br />Do you think the Pope would openly debate some philosopher or researcher or other religiosu head on national TV?
<br />
<br />See, if I'm the govt., and all I did was mis-manage -- not be prepared, not heed warnings, and then bungle the handling of the crisis -- but I was 100% sure of hte facts -- I wouldn't be hiding anything. I'd let anyone and everyone see for themsleves, let indepdent people analyze the steel and the rubble, not rush them off on trucks in the dark of night to barges to China. I'd get on CBS at 8pm to debate Griffin and Hoffman and bring in my counter-experts. So that we could all really feel comfortable.
<br />
<br />I'm open to some explanation that shows a counter-conspiracy. I remain flexible -- bring me evidence that all these bits n pieces that have been aggregating are nothing more than the counter-conspiratorial machinations of a few anti-Bushies?!! I'm open to being convinced the other way. Can you handle the possibility that you've been lied to? That's it's more comfortable to believe that 'no way, they couldn't pull that off, they wouldn't do that...&quot;. Why are you so adamant that it couldn't be as some suggest.
<br />
<br />Again, I don't know exactly what did or didn't happen. I know that I'm not convinced that those airplanes explain the coming down of hte Towers in the mannter it occured nor according to the now accepted mainstream explanations on teh science of it all -- and tehre appears to be a lot of credible evidence and analysis to suggest otherwise. What it means from tehre -- is up to continued debate.
<br />
<br />And calling me names doesn't do anything.</div>

			<div class="content">You can mock me all you want. If you want to actually present something that refutes all the disparate voices and the things they claim are conclusive evidence. I'm happy to consider it. I've heard some of these voices answer some of the critics or alternate views, I don't hear much of that in reverese.
<br />
<br />I called for an open debate with so-called experts on both sides -- and then let's see what we all think?
<br />
<br />I also seriously doubt you have reviewed in depth any sources I've lead you to. Nor can you contradict all the things they indicate. What about the video with the police and fireman -- they were just confused. Mis-perceiving.
<br />
<br />Yeah, I believe in little green men, and Big Foot, and Darth Vader and I have a poster of Fox Muldaur on my wall. Whatever... 
<br />
<br />That's high level. Cool. You got me, you called me out, made me look like a dope. Exposed my paranoid delusions.
<br />
<br />I said before -- I don't know exactly what happened. I'm fairly confident that Towers did not come down the way the Nova program and other official accounts explain it. I'd welcome and open debate between scientists and engineers on prime-time TV , and I'd like no excuses about we lost the files, the tapes, can't find the schematics, can't open that up because of national security. Let's have the debate for all to see. Do you all oppose that? Because if you do, then you are exposed, as unwilling, like a devout religious person of a particular faith -- to consider anything that could show fallacy or crush the foundation of your faith.
<br />
<br />Many of you seem unwilling to consider that this could have been planned and executed. That's your religion. You counter-claim, that I'm a member of a whacko religion equally unable to consider that your religion is more sound. You deride my religion, call it Spagetthi Monster etc...
<br />
<br />What are you open to? What kind of critical thinker are you?
<br />
<br />Tell me - what would it take to even get you to consider that there could be more layers to what happened that day, than has been commonly accepted by the mainstream press? What would convince you that the Towers could not have come down in the fashion they did without explosives, that the planes and jet fuel fire was not capable of causing the results and in the form they occured?
<br />
<br />But that's ok. It's easier to sleep at night believing that your govt., is on the up n up, and that powerful forces would never conspire to do more than sell you bad products or sub-prime mortgages.
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I've explained my views. What seems reasonable and not reasonable to me. If you want ot keep taking pot shots at me, that's fine. Doesn't sway me nor impress me.</div>

<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The 9/11 Truthers claim that the twin towers were brought down by controlled demolition. Okay. <br /><br />Have you ever seen a controlled demolition? Shows like this are all over The Discovery Channel. Do these people realize how all of the insulation and paneling must be stripped away from the support beams? Do they not understand how these beams must be cut open and the explosives placed with great care? Have they not any idea of the amount of time this takes -- months -- and the forest of wires that runs through the structure to the detonating mechanism? Have they given no thought -- none? -- to what an enormous job this is, and how much work goes into getting these explosives exactly where they need to be? <br /><br />Apparently not. They just figure someone leaves a suitcase somewhere, I guess. <br /><br />Anyone who has ever -- ever -- seen what is required to bring down a building of that size knows that the site is a disaster area of det cord, pulled paneling, and huge bundles of explosives taped to the structural columns across many floors. Has no one considered that this all had to be started after everyone went home on Monday night and before people reported for work the next day? On multiple floors of two of the busiest public spaces in the world? <br /><br />No one noticed this on Tuesday morning? Hey Jim, what do you suppose that huge bundle of plastic explosives is doing there where the water cooler used to be? And where do those wires go? Well, must be some logical explanation. Let's get some coffee and bagels. <br /><br />Now you're talking! <br /><br />Of all the people in those buildings that morning, no one -- no one -- saw any wires anywhere? No one asked why the drywall was torn down and replaced with grey stuff duct-taped into place? None of the firemen rushing into those burning towers, checking all those floors for survivors -- none of them noticed the building was rigged to explode? That it might possibly be worth a small call on the radio? <br /><br />My father was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 2002. I will never forget that day. It changed my life, and it was the event that started me writing here at Eject! Eject! Eject! <br /><br />The man who coordinated that service was on a hill about a half-mile from that side of the Pentagon on the morning of September 11th, 2001. He told me that they had been informed that something was going on in New York that morning. Then he heard something that he said he thought was a missile attack -- a roar so loud and so far beyond a normal jet sound that he looked up at that exact moment expecting to die. <br /><br />What he saw emerge from the trees overhead, perhaps a hundred feet above him, was American Airlines Flight 77 as it went by in a silver blur, engines screaming in a power dive as it hit the near side of the Pentagon. He told me -- to my face -- that body parts had rained down all over that sacred field. Just like red hail on a summer day. Those body parts are buried in a special place at the base of that hill. <br /><br />Now. If Rosie O'Donnell and the rest of that Lunatic Brigade is right and I am wrong, then that man -- that insignificant Army chaplain and his Honor Guard of forty men -- are all liars. He is lying to me for Halliburton and Big Oil. That Chaplain -- and all of those decent, patriotic young men in the Honor Guard, and all the commuters on the roads who saw an American Airlines jet instead of a missile -- all of those people are liars and accessories to murder. And all of the firefighters who went into buildings rigged to explode were pre-recruited suicide martyrs dying for George W. Bush's plans for world conquest. Remember: NOTHING that happened on September 11th needed any more explanation than what was obvious from the second impact... namely, that Islamic terrorists hijacked four American aircraft and flew three of them into their targets. To try to convince people of missile attacks and rigged explosives and mystery jets is nothing more than an intentional assault on reason and common sense, one that damns the innocent and protects those mass murderers with our blood on their hands. </div></blockquote>

<br />p.s. P-t-k: so you know, I do plan to read and/or watch as much of the things you posted and respond. One of the first things I've noticed upon quick glance at your links is that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">trained <span style="font-weight: bold">theologian</span></a> has written many articles and books attempting to debunk the science-based 9/11 debunking work of trained engineers and physicists, including the Popular Mechanics piece. <span style="font-style: italic">Muy interesante. </span>I also notice that I can go watch an <span style="font-weight: bold">architect <span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;">(note: not an engineer)</span></span>explain to me how Building 7<span style="font-style: italic">really </span>fell (i'll bet it was via explosives!). His money quote: â€œTwo small fires â€” even large, hot-burning, long-lasting fires â€” have never brought down a steel frame highrise building, ever.&quot; I haven't read or watched everything yet, but let's just say your sources aren't looking so credible thus far. And by the way--what's with these conspiracy theorists? Have they no sense of web design?</div>

			<div class="content">The problem with conspiracy theories isn't just that they're false, it's that they serve the very interests the conspiracy theorists claim to be unmasking. The belief that some secret cabal planned 9-11 provides cover for the very real incompetents that allowed it to happen. It obscures the cynical way the Bush people exploited the event for their own purposes. The notion that the government is controlled by some secret association allows the lobbyists and interests groups that really do call the shots operate out in the open.</div>

Okay. <br /><br />Have you ever seen a controlled demolition? Shows like this are all over The Discovery Channel. Do these people realize how all of the insulation and paneling must be stripped away from the support beams? Do they not understand how these beams must be cut open and the explosives placed with great care? Have they not any idea of the amount of time this takes -- months -- and the forest of wires that runs through the structure to the detonating mechanism? Have they given no thought -- none? -- to what an enormous job this is, and how much work goes into getting these explosives exactly where they need to be? <br /><br />Apparently not. They just figure someone leaves a suitcase somewhere, I guess. <br /><br />Anyone who has ever -- ever -- seen what is required to bring down a building of that size knows that the site is a disaster area of det cord, pulled paneling, and huge bundles of explosives taped to the structural columns across many floors. Has no one considered that this all had to be started after everyone went home on Monday night and before people reported for work the next day? On multiple floors of two of the busiest public spaces in the world? <br /><br />No one noticed this on Tuesday morning? Hey Jim, what do you suppose that huge bundle of plastic explosives is doing there where the water cooler used to be? And where do those wires go? Well, must be some logical explanation. Let's get some coffee and bagels. <br /><br />Now you're talking! <br /><br />Of all the people in those buildings that morning, no one -- no one -- saw any wires anywhere? No one asked why the drywall was torn down and replaced with grey stuff duct-taped into place? None of the firemen rushing into those burning towers, checking all those floors for survivors -- none of them noticed the building was rigged to explode? That it might possibly be worth a small call on the radio? <br /><br />My father was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 2002. I will never forget that day. It changed my life, and it was the event that started me writing here at Eject! Eject! Eject! <br /><br />The man who coordinated that service was on a hill about a half-mile from that side of the Pentagon on the morning of September 11th, 2001. He told me that they had been informed that something was going on in New York that morning. Then he heard something that he said he thought was a missile attack -- a roar so loud and so far beyond a normal jet sound that he looked up at that exact moment expecting to die. <br /><br />What he saw emerge from the trees overhead, perhaps a hundred feet above him, was American Airlines Flight 77 as it went by in a silver blur, engines screaming in a power dive as it hit the near side of the Pentagon. He told me -- to my face -- that body parts had rained down all over that sacred field. Just like red hail on a summer day. Those body parts are buried in a special place at the base of that hill. <br /><br />Now. If Rosie O'Donnell and the rest of that Lunatic Brigade is right and I am wrong, then that man -- that insignificant Army chaplain and his Honor Guard of forty men -- are all liars. He is lying to me for Halliburton and Big Oil. That Chaplain -- and all of those decent, patriotic young men in the Honor Guard, and all the commuters on the roads who saw an American Airlines jet instead of a missile -- all of those people are liars and accessories to murder. And all of the firefighters who went into buildings rigged to explode were pre-recruited suicide martyrs dying for George W. Bush's plans for world conquest. Remember: NOTHING that happened on September 11th needed any more explanation than what was obvious from the second impact... namely, that Islamic terrorists hijacked four American aircraft and flew three of them into their targets. To try to convince people of missile attacks and rigged explosives and mystery jets is nothing more than an intentional assault on reason and common sense, one that damns the innocent and protects those mass murderers with our blood on their hands. </div></blockquote><br /><br />p.s. P-t-k: so you know, I do plan to read and/or watch as much of the things you posted and respond. One of the first things I've noticed upon quick glance at your links is that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">trained <span style="font-weight: bold">theologian</span></a> has written many articles and books attempting to debunk the science-based 9/11 debunking work of trained engineers and physicists, including the Popular Mechanics piece. <span style="font-style: italic">Muy interesante. </span>I also notice that I can go watch an <span style="font-weight: bold">architect <span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;">(note: not an engineer)</span></span>explain to me how Building 7<span style="font-style: italic">really </span>fell (i'll bet it was via explosives!). His money quote: â€œTwo small fires â€” even large, hot-burning, long-lasting fires â€” have never brought down a steel frame highrise building, ever.&quot; I haven't read or watched everything yet, but let's just say your sources aren't looking so credible thus far. And by the way--what's with these conspiracy theorists? Have they no sense of web design?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Good question above about what it would have taken to pull of the setup. I'd luv to hear both sides debate it. That comment and the anecdotal stuff after it strike me as NO DIFFERENT than the other voices I've heard with equally reasonable assertions and anecdotal from others in military civil service and first-hand eye-witness accounts.
<br />
<br />As for the credibility of someone, because he's a professor PhD in Theology or some guy is an architecht -- we will never agree. You will find some reason to punch a hole in anything I present. I predicted this at the outset and its the very reason I tried to not get in to this game. Im' satisfied in how I've come to the conclusions and questions that I hold. I feel confident in my objectivity and remain cynical and cautious. I do not believe hook line and sinker every single shred of statement from people who think ther eis more to 911, but there is no one on this board who has any personal knowledge that can debunk or refute anything I've studied. You just have your own conclusions.
<br />
<br />Popular mechanics is held up by you, something else will be held up by someone else.
<br />
<br />I call for an open debate. Why shouldn't that happen? Oh, because one side is whackos and shouldn't be given the stage. 
<br />
<br />This is silly. No one here was ever open to anything. It's 2008, you have long since drawn your conclusions and Im' just another over-zealous fantastical conspiracy theorist. 
<br />
<br />You attack me like I'm an acutal investigative journalist, or theologian turned engineer. I've listened to hours of discussion, read 100's of pages, viewed lots of footage. I've heard responses to some of hte other side -- but if you expect me to stand here as an 'expert' ready to defend and sway you -- then you forget that I'm not just a citizen. Not an expert. I've never claimed expert status. I've never even said, that every link I post is something I agree with, or beleive 100%, i quickly gather then to suggest that there is a lot of other thinking going on and some interesting points of view and analysis that suggest other lines of thinking.
<br />
<br />I've gathered enough, to have MANY questions and concerns. I put that together with a historical analysis and my own personal experience on this planet and beging to cobble together a view. In the area of the physics of the Towers, I do not believe that it could crumble to dust as it did based on the plane crash alone. That's all I'm really saying. If you do, that's fine.
<br />
<br />If there are engineers on both sides, why not let them debate it in public?</div>

<br />
<br />see this statement right here is the PTK self righteous crap I can't stand....
<br />
<br />You make it sound like all of us are retarded, that we don't even acknowledge the fact it happened, and we are so helpless we can't do anything about it.... This is just wrong... Many other people go looking for the answers same as you, including me, problem is I nor a lot of other people get sucked into those paranoid delusion clubs.... Have you ever donated money to one of these things?? seriously, how much do you believe that a missle was fired into the pentagon.... atleast answer me that, do you believe a missle was fired into the pentagon.... do you believe the planes that hit the trade towers were manned with missles, i gotta know that one too.... I dont want to refute it, i only want to know what kind of believer you are, cause I've read them all....</div>
