			<div class="content">crossposted from the Comic Con thread-
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />From AICN- stuff revealed from the Lost Panel
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Somewhat spoilery
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color: white">From the Comic Con’s Thursday afternoon “Lost” panel with showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, cobbled from various reports:<br /><br />* Season four will feature both flashbacks and flashforwards. (Note that Herc’s longstanding plea that some episodes eliminate flashbacks was finally answered with the flashback-free third-season finale.)<br /><br />* We will learn how Ben Linus came to fall into Henry Gale’s trap.<br /><br />* At least one whole episode will follow Jack and Kate’s adventures away from Dharma Island.<br /><br />* Harold Perrineau arrives. The plan was always to bring Michael back, is the claim.<br /><br />* Richard Alpert “may” get limited screen time, as Nestor “Batmanuel” Carbonnel is now a regular on CBS’ Cuban-American nighttime soap “Cane.”<br /><br />* The story of Hurley’s girl, Libby, will be told in season four. Apparently one wouldn’t be “barking up the wrong tree” to suggest a connection with Dharma Island.<br /><br />* Rousseau will likely get a flashback in seasons four or five.<br /><br />* The session ended with a new Dharma orientation film. It’s for the “Orchid Station.” The man who identified himself in previous Dharma media as Mark Wickmund and Marvin Candle now calls himself “Edward Allawitz.” Allawitz apologizes for deceiving people with regard to the nature of the station’s research, which does not concern botany. Allawitz holds up a rabbit marked “15.” A nearby shelf is marked “16.” A small earthquake ensues. End of film.<br /><br />ABC launches the 16-episode fourth season of &quot;Lost&quot; early next year.</span></div></blockquote></div>

<br />I think CBS needs to take further precautions. They should restrict Nestor Carbonell to the &quot;Cane&quot; set. I think that if someone saw him somewhere in Los Angeles and then saw him on TV they would get confused.</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry this is so long. I've been rewatching the episodes and trying to work out some ideas and come up with a theory as to what the hell is going on!! (I don't want to 3 more years to find out!!) I hope you find this worth the read....
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />As any geography student knows, the land masses that make up the solid portions of the earth’s surface are part of tectonic plates that float on molten lava. The plates move at a usual rate somewhere in the range of 1/4 to 1 inch per year. As we sit here, the Hawaiian Islands are traveling north-west at a rate of just under 1/4 inch per year. As part of the island chain, scientists have found a “new” island approximately 900 feet below sea level that is rising each year and will break the surface of the ocean and become part of the visible chain in approximately 1,000 years. At the same time, parts of the Indian continent continue to sink and are dragging Australia downward with it. Scientists believe that Australia will be under water in roughly 1,500 years. 
<br />
<br />The fact that the land masses move so much and rise and fall so frequently is the crux of my theory of the Lost Island. I’m sure someone else has posted a similar theory (although I haven’t come across it yet) so forgive me if this has already been posed. This theory is based on the idea that the island is rising from the sea at a rapid rate - far quicker than normal plate tectonics allow. One of the most famous land masses to ever sink was Atlantis. I believe that the island in Lost may have been part of the land mass that contained that fabled city/continent. Atlantis was said to contain many mysterious properties including the legendary fountain of youth. 
<br />
<br />Plato described Atlantis as an idealistic state located in the Atlantic Ocean. Given the Greek conception of the world at the time, the Atlantic was imagined to be the ocean surrounding the former known continents, meaning Africa and Eurasia. This would place the fabled city west of Africa and south-west of Europe, but I actually think the island is somewhere in the Indian Ocean, North East of Madagascar.  In his description of Atlantis its landscape, nature and metropolis are incomparably beautiful and the culture is very advanced in technology, due to an unusually well educated population. In the end this island disappears into the sea due to an earthquake which might be related to gigantic sub-marine volcanic explosions. The result is a flood of h.uge proportions, coming over the land, destroying almost everything. The sea level rises a few hundred meters and so Atlantis sinks. This catastrophe is said to have happened during a single day and night. 
<br />
<br />How does this apply to Lost? Imagine that a ship called the Black Rock crashed into the island several hundred years ago. The survivors left the ship and explored the island in much the same way the 815 survivors did. They soon discovered that the island held great mysteries. One of the men aboard that ship was Richard and he along with the others soon found a fresh water supply on the island (perhaps even the one in the caves that Jack found in season one.) This water supply managed to stop the aging process - i.e. they discovered the fountain of youth! This would certainly explain why Richard seemingly hasn’t aged while Ben continued to grow from an adolescent to an adult. Richard drank from the water source while Ben was still drinking water supplied by the Dharma Initiative. Meanwhile, over the next several hundred years the island has continued to rise from the sea - which explains the location of the remains of the Black Rock so far inland. 
<br />
<br />With the island located in the Indian Ocean it opens the door for an explanation of how Yemi’s plane landed there. Being just off the African continent and not thousands of miles away, it would certainly be within the 1,000 mile range of the Beechcraft plane Yemi was flying in if it refueled near the Eastern coast. Remember that pilot said that they got lost after turning back towards the west in an effort to get to Fiji. Given that fact, it seems far more likely that flight 815 unknowingly traveled West when taking off and not East, than it does for a Beechcraft with a 1,000 mile range to manage to travel 11,000 miles without refueling. 
<br />
<br />Also supporting this idea is that fact that the plane crashed in daylight. According to Lostpedia, flight 815 left Australia at 2:55 PM. (Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 departed from Sydney, Australia on September 22 2004, at 14:55, from gate 23, flying to Los Angeles, California, USA where it would arrive at 10:42.) But according to the entry logs on Sept. 22, 2004 Desmond failed to push the button at 4:16 AM. Yes I said AM that’s not a mistake. The entry log Desmond checked states: System Failure Sept 2204416. If it had been PM it would have read Sept 22041616 instead of 416. How did they lose 13 hours? If they left Australia and headed West instead of East it explains both problems. So the question s, was the pilot intentionally taking that flight path or was he just completely incompetent? 
<br />
<br />OK back to the main point about the island's origin.  Atlantis was said to have a capital city divided into rings by canals with statues at the outer entrances to the city. The four toed statue was a common element of early Greek mythology so the statue we saw in season two finale certainly fits in with this theory. Also according to Plato Atlantis was said to have a great power source at its center. Sound familiar? 
<br />
<br />A few more things about Greek methology that supports this idea. Phevos and Athena, the Greek Gods, are usually depicted with four toes on each foot. 
<br />
<br />Phevos is better known as Apollo who is the Greek god of light; god of prophesy , poetry, music and healing. (Healing & prophesy. Healing is a property of the island. Prophesy is the prediction of future events. A general term for assertions presented as the revelation of divine will or to put it another way, fate! I believe that the producers gave us a clue by using Apollo as the name on the candy bars Kate and Hurley ate in the hatch.) Apollo was also supposed to have been born on a mythical island and had a twin sister named Artemis (who was believed to be the guardian of women in childbirth.) 
<br />
<br />Athena was the The daughter of Zeus and Metis and was the goddess of wisdom, the practical arts, and warfare, and the protector of cities. Athena sprang into being fully formed and fully armed from the head of her father, after Zeus had swallowed the pregnant Metis. A warlike virgin, Pallas Athene eschewed senseless violence, unlike the war god Ares, and relied on the boldness of wisdom.</div>

			<div class="content">OK, so that's part of the history of the island - what about some of what we've learned since? What if Ethan didn’t actually travel between the island and the “real world” but was instead at both places at the same time? The Orchid video seemed to show that two of the same animals (and therefore presumably people) could exist in the same time as long as they didn’t come in direct contact with each other. This theory uses that concept and takes it a step further. I propose that “the Others” is a reference to a group of scientists who volunteered to travel back in time using Edgar Hallowax’s gear. The idea is that they were transported to a time in which they already existed, so they essentially have created a “duplicate” of themselves, albeit an older version. This would work as long as the “duplicates” and “originals” have no possibility of encountering each other - thus the need for the island. The island would serve multiple purposes; first isolating the duplicates from any possibility of encountering their younger selves or original time line occupants (hereafter refereed to as the “originals”). Secondly the island would serve to hide their research and experiments from the rest of the world. This concept would certainly explain a few things. 
<br />
<br />To start with it would explain why Ben said that he “couldn’t” let anyone leave the island — the reason of course is that they might come in contact with their original. Which also explains why he said the sub provided the “illusion” that people could leave whenever they wanted too. It may also explain the fertility problems if time travel effects the duplicates ability to reproduce. This is a separate theory that I’ll save for another thread. This idea would also explain Mikhail’s seeming ability to overcome death. I am supposing that if a person traveling back in time were to die while there was still another version of him in existence, it would mean that he could essentially know when he died and be able to avoid it again the next time. 
<br />
<br />For example, let’s say that there is a group of researchers in 2007 that includes a 30 year old Fred Brown. Fred travels back in time to 1997 and is killed while crossing the street on July 15, 1998. His death is recorded but since the 20 year old Fred is still alive (remember it’s his duplicate that was killed) 20 year old Fred’s life continues as before. When he eventually reaches the point in his life when he is to travel to 1997, he would have access to the death certificates, news stories etc that recorded his death and therefore could already know that he is to avoid crossing that street in 1998. This would be much easier if time traveling Fred was working with a group who would record the events leading to his death in a way that would insure he saw the information prior to traveling back in time. 
<br />
<br />OK, let’s back up a minute and put this entire idea into the framework of the show. 
<br />
<br />It’s the 1970’s and Gerald DeGroot is a scientist who is committed to finding a solution to avoid the destruction of mankind as predicted by the Valenzetti Equation. He forms the Dharma Initiative, and over the next several decades they uncover amazing principals in the 80’s leading to the possibility of time travel via the Casmir Effect. Once they achieved time travel DeGroot decides that in order to gain as much time as possible to solve this problem, he splits the Initiative into two, one group which will remain in modern times and a group of other scientists who will travel back in time. The time travelers will travel to the early 60’s using the principles demonstrated in the Orchid video. They choose the early 60’s because it affords them the most time possible for their research while still having access to somewhat useful scientific equipment. (Traveling back to the 1940’s for instance would mean the equipment of that period would be far too simplistic to be useful to their needs.) Since all of them are traveling to a time in which they previously lived, it means that they need to isolate their future selves from any possibility of a duplicate encountering their original. They find an island with amazing properties and decide to use it to hide their research and isolate themselves. 
<br />
<br />In order to free as much time as possible for them to work on their research, they begin to hire “regular” people from that time period to help with the day to day running of the facilities. It’s a time when ecology and peace movements are common themes in popular culture and Dharma uses these concepts to cloak their real activities from the “workers” helping to maintain the facilities. They also set up a support operation which provides supplies to them on a regular basis. One of the people they hire to work on the island is Roger Linus and his son Ben. Dharma builds the hatches and observation facilities and sets up fake “experiments” to conceal their real research. Their actual findings are encoded into a computer database to be stored until their modern day researchers (those who remained behind) can use it to solve the Valenzetti Equation. To insure the research is only used by the Dharma researchers, a storage facility is created and linked to the swan station. A self destruct sequence is enacted which must be rest every 108 minutes or the station and the research (as well as the hopes of mankind’s continued existence) will be destroyed. 
<br />
<br />Flash back to the 1600’s and the The Black Rock. Among the group of people on board is Richard Alpert who has strong psychic abilities which seem to increase the longer he’s on the island. He begins to have a spiritual understanding of the island (much like Locke) and soon he and a few of other survivors have contact with a very strong force - a psychic presence named Jacob who to attempts to communicate with them. The Black Rock survivors begin to understand that the original island inhabitants are in fact still there - not physically present, but mentally and spiritually a part of the island. They are led to the water source and soon devote themselves to understanding the higher force that Jacob represents. 
<br />
<br />Back on the island in the 1960’s Jacob learns of a young boy with very strong abilities who is on the island. In fact Ben has the strongest psychic abilities of anyone on the island and Jacob makes contact with him by appearing as the image of his Mother in his bedroom window. Soon Ben learns that Jacob will accept him and offers him love and understanding that he doesn’t get from his abusive Father. Jacob is able to impart to Richard that Ben should join the Black Rock survivors. Through Ben, Jacob reveals that the Black Rock survivors and the technological dependant researchers can not co-exist on the island. Attempting to live together will lead to an all out war and the eventual destruction of the island. 
<br />
<br />Ben and Richard decide on purging the research group which will allow them free access to the entire island and it’s series of hatches to further their understanding of Jacob and the powers he represents. They will also be able to utilize the food and supply drops by Dharma. Ben agrees to lead the assault but insists that his girlfriend Annie be spared. Over the next several decades the inhabitants develop strong ties to Jacob and learn much of the mysteries of the island and it’s inhabitants. One issue that arises that can not be overcome - the woman on the island die in child birth. Ben immediately recognizes the issue from his experience with his own mother but never reveals it to anyone out of fear. Meanwhile Ben continues to deceive the Dharma Initiative researchers who provide the supply drops. They are aware that there was a conflict with the “natives” and that an illness has killed many of the research team and the support group leaving ben as the group leader. Ben is able to manipulate the Dharma group to providing him with materials and funding to hire new workers and some additional researchers. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile the remaining members of the Dharma Initiative who stayed behind continue their research, but they are disheartened at the lack of information being provided by the island researchers. Several members of the Initiate become disenchanted and leave the group. The head of the wealthy and powerful conglomerate Widmore Industries, Charles Widmore has heard whispers and rumors of a research station on an island with magical powers. He believes he can exploit the island’s properties to benefit his company and increase his own power and soon begins to hire some of the former Dharma Initiative researchers. He is soon persuaded that the island is real and that it’s properties will make him extremely powerful and so launches a search to find the island. He begins to identify an approximate area but can’t pin point the exact location. The island’s properties appear to cloak it from standard radar and all attempts to find it fail. He begins to sponsor world crossing races which will bring the racers close to the island. With GPS surveillance equipment he tracks the various hot air balloons, boats and planes as they travel near the island. Those that are lost near the island have their last known locations marked and search boats launched. Soon he is able to track the location of the island to a very small area where he locates several large ships waiting for an exact location to be determined. One of his workers is Naomi and her satellite phone has provided the exact coordinates he has searched for. The battle for the island is about to begin!!</div>
