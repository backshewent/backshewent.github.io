I think a lot of us on here get hung up on what should he have done differently and look at the 25 man roster, and I'm not sure there is a whole lot that he should have done differently there. For a max payroll contending team you have to have the best you can on the 25 man roster, you aren't trading one of your cornerstones in 2011 when you are on track to win 102 games. You just aren't going to do it, maybe you could have messed with the fringes a bit but doing that wasn't going to get you what you need to compete tomorrow so it's really a moot point. <br />Building a team through free agency is not the way you win anymore (was it ever?), you have to have young talent and you have to develop it to b successful, it's not even a matter of dollars anymore, it's just a matter of production. It is extremely rare for a good productive player to get to free agency at any age, when you look at the impending free agent list it's not full of guys we can't afford, it's full of guys we don't want, their old or flawed or both. Where I think the organization in general failed itself is really in the acquisition of young talent. I know that you can't change where you draft, but baseball was pretty unique where there are multiple avenues to acquire entry level talent, even when talking about the ameture draft. As the organization was making more money and putting more money into the 25 man, they should have been looking for ways to supplement the farm system with young talent, through international signings and over slot draft signings. <br />When you look at the consistently good teams like the cards, they aren't drafting high and they aren't signing huge FA's, they are building a core group and then consistently turning over their role players with cheap guys from their system who step in and contribute.</div>

And one is hurt bd and the team has lost the vast majority of another's starts.<br /><br />Kendrick as a four and Lannan/Mr. Pettibone as a five is a solid guess as to being pretty good for their roles.  <br /><br />If you were to make a bet a few years ago that Utley and Rollins would agree pretty well I think you would be pretty happy with that bet.  <br /><br />Going with young, hard throwing guys instead of expensive fungible vet relievers is supposed to be a smart move.<br /><br />If there was anyone on this board in 2009- 2011 saying we should get rid of Halladay and Hamels and Rollins and Utley I'd be surprised.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The more I think about it, the more I'm falling into the Rube did a real bad job camp and it is not due to what you outlined here. I think a lot of us on here get hung up on what should he have done differently and look at the 25 man roster, and I'm not sure there is a whole lot that he should have done differently there. For a max payroll contending team you have to have the best you can on the 25 man roster, you aren't trading one of your cornerstones in 2011 when you are on track to win 102 games. You just aren't going to do it, maybe you could have messed with the fringes a bit but doing that wasn't going to get you what you need to compete tomorrow so it's really a moot point. <br />Building a team through free agency is not the way you win anymore (was it ever?), you have to have young talent and you have to develop it to b successful, it's not even a matter of dollars anymore, it's just a matter of production. It is extremely rare for a good productive player to get to free agency at any age, when you look at the impending free agent list it's not full of guys we can't afford, it's full of guys we don't want, their old or flawed or both. Where I think the organization in general failed itself is really in the acquisition of young talent. I know that you can't change where you draft, but baseball was pretty unique where there are multiple avenues to acquire entry level talent, even when talking about the ameture draft. As the organization was making more money and putting more money into the 25 man, they should have been looking for ways to supplement the farm system with young talent, through international signings and over slot draft signings. <br />When you look at the consistently good teams like the cards, they aren't drafting high and they aren't signing huge FA's, they are building a core group and then consistently turning over their role players with cheap guys from their system who step in and contribute.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You make good points.  Although I will say that many teams' top ten prospect lists are littered with guys we drafted and developed to a certain extent.  We used those guys to get Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee and Roy Oswalt and Hunter Pence (Booooooo.  But really, he is having another pretty good year) and guys like that.  <br /><br />Again, the minor league teams are lousy with international guys.  Our number one prospect is an international signing.  Our number 3 prospect is an international signing.<br /><br />The one area I wholeheartedly agree we have done crappy at is signing the real good Cuban hitters and Japanese and Korean pitchers.  (That said, Cespedes is already showing signs of decline. -- but who knows, he may be Micky Mantle plus Babe Ruth times Willie Mays in the second half).<br /><br />The Cardinals are interesting.  I'm pretty sure their farm system was supposed to be lousy a few years ago.  A bunch of their young guys who are doing well in the big leagues were not heralded as great prospects.  Have they been really good or just kinda lucky?  A little of both I suspect but I lean towards the really good side a bit more.<br /><br />I don't know that the Cards have been big players on the international market.  Or that they have made a lot of over slot draft picks.  <br /><br />I don't think Amaro is a great GM or even a good one.  He has some very strong characteristics.  He was not afraid to trade prospects to get players he wanted.  Halladay, Lee, Oswalt and Pence.  He likes cost certainty.  He isn't patient in contract negotiations at times-- Madson and others.  <br /><br />These strong characteristics led us to a few years of great success.  But they also have resulted in the not so hot position we are in today.  It happens.  Baseball is a funny game.  What works for a while in one place doesn't work all the time.  What works in one place doesn't work in another.  <br /><br />I guess there is a view point that a BSG poster who we really don't know anything about but is a high powered executive but who posts on here a lot (Calvin Ball maybe, we don't REALLY know him) when he's not moving and shaking things up in the business world 20 hours a day could have had just as much success as Amaro did.  Because it isn't really all that hard.</div>

			<div class="content">Baseball is no different than any other industry at the management level and I think the argument that it isn't is frankly pretty silly.  What a non-baseball-lifer would miss is the ability to easily spot talent, although (1) that is an acquired skill not an innate skill and (2) a great manager would surround himself with the right talent evaluators.  The idea that Amaro or Steve Phillips of Bill Bavasi or even some decent GMs would be better than Jack Welch or Lou Palmisano is, in my view, ridiculous.</div>

			<div class="content">I think there's some truth to the idea that &quot;management is management,&quot; though there's a limit. Where I think Shore and McNeal and others are correct is that Amaro failed--and more importantly, continues to fail--in what's sometimes referred to as SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats). To do that well might not require having played, or even having worked in an FO. <br /><br />Just talking about 2013, amaro doesn't seem to grasp that the team's sole remaining competitive advantage is its big payroll... so he'll fail to take on salary for better prospect return. Today's problem is the fruit of yesterday's opportunity missed: he needs the prospects because he didn't see the opportunity of spending more in the draft and internationally back when the rules enabled that without consequences. I could go on: he recognized the weakness of his aging offense too late (2011), then was foolish in trying to address it (ever since).<br /><br />Managers have to be egotistical enough to pursue their chosen course with total commitment, yet egoless enough to change when the facts dictate doing so. That means recognizing sunk costs and not throwing good money after bad. If its true that Amaro won't trade Papelbon--that he's going to lock himself into the declining years of a fastball reliever who's not getting any cheaper--it will confirm, for anyone who still doubts, that his analytical capacity is really lacking. <br /><br />I think if smitty has a point, it's that functioning as a baseball GM probably entails more than content knowledge: it's trust among peers, bosses and subordinates, and an understanding of the culture of the game informed by experience. Jack Welch might be a great owner/boss of a GM; I wouldn't want him making trades or draft picks.</div>
