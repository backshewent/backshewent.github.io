This is apparently not the time or place for nuance.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think this is a fair-ish point.  Worse case scenario for &quot;normal&quot; conservatives is our worst case scenario (Trump going full alt-right), but the best case scenario is that Trump trends towards &quot;normal&quot; conservative and JH gets most of what he would have wanted out of a Rubio or Bush.  If he is seen celebrating now, or in the future, he would be shouting down for celebrating the accomplishments of a xenophobic, racist, bigoted, insecure pig.  <br /><br />It's not an enviable position to be in, and I'm sure JH is uncertain and perhaps fearful of his party's future.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think anyone should be scared about the party's future, but there has to be a huge acknowledgement that this is their Frankenstein's Monster.  Giving a bunch of looney tunes a voice in that party's political process created this, and that party establishment should receive a large share of the blame for that.</div></blockquote><br /><br />or maybe I'm wrong.  maybe they've always been nutso?  what the fuck do I know?

He didn't appear to want to converse back and forth all that much. you have in the past. how exactly are you approaching the coming administration?</div>

I don’t believe a woman was created to run this country based on the fact that the woman was taken from the man’s rib.”<br /><br />Adding, “Woman wasn’t created first. The man was created first. The woman was created second. I believe that’s how God wanted the pecking order to be.”<br /><br />Russo does, however, admit that his perceived role of women is important … saying, “I think that women have the most important job! I think giving birth and rearing kids and raising kids, and molding and shaping other human beings is more important than being a leader.”<br /><br />The pundit then goes on to take issue with a listener who labeled him as sexist for his views, but defends his position that men and women aren’t created equal because they have different genitalia.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br /><br />Dude needs to read more of his bible, there are plenty of strong women pushing boundaries in there. Sure, more men, but there was an audience to consider back there 2000-ish years ago.</div>

			<div class="content">Werthless, I think those are all fair points, even if I disagree with you about the &quot;shouted down&quot; part. Sure, these threads have their moments, but I've been on a lot of message boards over the past 15 or so years, and this is easily one of the most consistently respectful political discussions I've ever encountered. Even on the UVA message board--where you presumably have people who come from pretty similar backgrounds--the politics message board is typically a dumpster fire. These threads occasionally devolve into name calling and can get emotional, but I think that we also do a pretty good job of self-policing on that point.</div>
