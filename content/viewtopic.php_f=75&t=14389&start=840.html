You're in it for the game more than the actual substance of the prize. But that's just an impression based on message board posts. I think it's quite hard to tell much based on posts. I think the core of the republican party in DC is now made up of people that would  be very happy to turn the clock back to pre-Roosevelt. I think they would be happy to take the money from the middle class and make a huge class of poor. You know, like they do in the Mariana Islands. But I'm not sure what their intentions say about you, probably not much. Like I said,I think you're in it for the game,but that's just an impression.</div></blockquote><br />The last time this came up I wrote up <a href="viewtopic.php_f=2&t=14060&p=1608882&#p1608882" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">a list of 10 issues I really care about</a>, and the reason I support the Republican Party is because I believe they're the significantly more likely to enact policy in power that I care about. <br /><br />The absurdity of you making this argument when the discussion today has centered around me defending the policy of the President of the United States, who presumably is on the other team, is lost on you because you don't actually care what anyone who disagrees with you writes before launching into your same trope about nefarious conservatives and the rich and Grover Norquist (whom I don't particularly like and the number one thing on my list up there is for tax reform that leads to an increase in government revenue, but knowing that would require actually paying attention to what I say about issues and not assuming I ascribe your weird, fixed notion of what all evil conservatives believe as you go into your form letter reply).<br /><br />I find elections significantly more fascinating and entertaining than policy making. I post more about elections than policy making because I follow them more closely. I almost always support the Republican candidate. I am pretty amoral about campaign tactics. I don't know why people jump from those facts to thinking I don't care about policy. I wouldn't be invested in the outcome of elections if I didn't care about the policy implications. I've learned quite a bit about policy posting here from some liberals, especially dajafi, docsmooth and TV, and I think I post more about policy issues now than I did five years ago when I was still working in the campaign world. Wish I could put a few people on ignore in this thread only with whom I generally have less than productive interactions, but I won't because I don't want to be ignoring posts in all the other threads. Going forward I'll try and do a better job of not getting into these long, personal back and forths.</div></blockquote><br />If those are the ten things that you most believe in, then I think you have simply failed to recognize that you are yet another northern Republican, whose party has left you behind.  I think the Dems are likely to give you as many of these 10 things as today's Republican Party, which basically represents the evangelical South.  But, let's look at your list:<br />1) A tax code with fewer deductions and lower rates that raises more revenue than the current tax code. Corporate tax rate cut and simplified as well to be more competitive with other countries/encourage multinational corps not to hide their money overseas. THIS WOULD PASS MUSTER WITH DEMS, IFFY WITH REPUBS<br />2) Serious effort at tackling the long term growth of entitlement spending TOUGH SELL WITH BOTH PARTIES.  OBAMA HAS SAID HE WOULD ACCEPT THIS, BUT CONGRESSIONAL DEMS LIKELY TO ACCEPT.  REPUBS HAVEN'T REALLY TACKLED THIS WITH SPECIFICS THAT ARE LIKELY TO WORK<br />3) Public sector unions to be greatly curtailed if not completely destroyed REPUBS CERTAINLY LIKELY TO DO THIS.  I DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT OF DESTROYED, ALTHOUGH SOME CURTAILING WOULD BE A PLUS<br />4) Affirmative action to disappear forever, or at least become based on socioeconomic status and not race based REPUBS MORE LIKELY TO DO THIS AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO DO.  I THINK DEMS WOULD ACCEPT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BASED ON SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS<br />5) The federal government to allow oil and gas production in more places (Alaska, offshore, etc.) BOTH PARTIES HAVE DONE THIS.  OIL COMPANIES HAVE AS MANY PLACES TO DIG AS THEY HAVE RIGS.  FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN ATLANTIC BEING OFF LIMITS WAS ORIGINALLY A DEMAND OF REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERSHIP OF THOSE STATES.  DEMS AREN'T GOING TO DRILL IN NATIONAL PARKS AND WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES, BUT DO WE REALLY NEED TO.<br />6) Gov't to maybe spend a bit less on defense, especially looking at problems in the procurement process as people like Sen. Coburn have been talking about, but not change things too much there DEMS WILL DO, REPUBLICANS WILL NOT.  LAST CAMPAIGN, ROMNEY CAMPAIGNED ON SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SPENDING AND THAT SEEMED REPUB MAINSTREAM<br />7) Gay marriage to be legal NOT WITH REPUBS.  DEMS APPROVE<br />8) Vigorous pursuit of free trade deals - bilateral, regional MIXED BAG FOR BOTH PARTIES.  REPUBS CONCOCT TRADE DEALS TO SKEWER LABOR AND SHIELD FARMERS AND EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES DEMS MORE PROTECTIVE OF UNIONIZED INDUSTRIES, BOTH STUPID ON CHINA<br />9) Federally directed or encouraged K-12 education experiments like Race to the Top continued/emphasized DEMS YES, POST-BUSH REPUBS, NO<br />10) Comprehensive immigration reform, something like McCain/Ted Kennedy were proposing under GWB DEMS YES, POST-BUSH REPUBS, NO</div>

I had to re-type it so I apologize for any typos:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The fact that an operation may target a U.S. citizen does alter this conclusion.  As explained above, the Supreme Court has held that the military may constitutionally use force against a U.S. citizen who is a part of enemy forces.  Similarly, under the Constitution and the inherent right to national self-defense recognized in international law, the President may authorize a use of force against a U.S. citizen who is a member of al-Qa'ida or its associated forces and who poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.</div></blockquote><br /><br />(citations omitted)<br /><br />It further goes on to discuss how it wouldn't violate assassination ban and must be conducted in accordance with the laws or war.<br /><br />Soooo... where is the limitation on borders?  Simply the prohibition on the use of US military assets within the US, would be my guess.  But there's already bans on targeted assassinations, and the WH carefully maneuvers around that problem, so why wouldn't we expect more of the same?</div></blockquote><br />I think not using the American military against American citizens on American soil is a pretty bright line.</div></blockquote><br />IIRC, Posse Comitatus prohibits all but the Coast Guard and National Guard from conducting military actions on US soil without an act of congress.  It used to require governor consent for something like a natural disaster or state of emergency, but GWB overrode that requirement with the Defense Authorization Act.  But I think you still need an act of congress to conduct actual military shootin' an' bombin' action within our borders (like if Canada invades).</div></blockquote><br />No, Posse Comitatus prohibits the US military from being used to enforce state law.  I did some reading on this last night.  It's not a blanket prohibition on the use of federal forces.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act</a>  In fact, the military can be used by the President within US borders pursuant to the Insurrection Act.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act</a></div></blockquote><br />But anything short of Canada invading (like a US citizen conducting terrorist activities in Kalamazoo) falls to the DOJ.  Waco and Ruby Ridge were conducted by arms of the DOJ (ATF/FBI) along with local/state law enforcement.<br /><br />If Canada invades, I propose the act of congress be titled &quot;The Round Ham Is NOT Bacon Act&quot;.</div>

You try to kill as many of the enemy soldiers as possible while losing as few of possible of your own.  You also go after the enemy leaders, when you can.  An individual soldier doesn't need to be actively plotting anything to be legitimately killed.  Most enemy soldiers don't plot, they attack and try to kill, when their leaders tell them to.  Fighting a war does not require proving that individual enemy soldiers are 'criminals' before you try to kill them.  I assume that most of them are just doing their patriotic duty for their country and responding to their leaders' shaping their view of events, just as our soldiers are.  That doesn't mean it isn't totally legit to try to kill the poor bastards, when they are at war with us.  The rules of war were established between nations and apply to both sides.  You don't gain additional rights of due process by deciding to give yourself an advantage by not wearing a uniform and blending into the civilian population.  Since those are both violations of the laws of war, logically they might diminish your rights, but they can't add to them.  In no war have individual decisions of where to bomb, which enemy position should be shelled or over-run, etc. been discussed in public before it happened.  To do so would remove the element of surprise.  As to the killing of American citizens in the ranks of AQ, there is precedent for killing American citizens who joined the Nazi army.  No special legal rights because they were American.  No judicial action required.  And these were guys who, although they had deserted their nation to fight for its enemy, were at least following all of the rules of war.  Al-Awaki was clearly a member of AQ, he posted as much and taped as much, including calls for Jihad against America.  It was no secret that he was on a list of people who could be killed.  His father knew about it and actually tried to challenge his listing in court.  This is not randomly and for no good reason killing an American out walking on a street somewhere in the civilized world based on a bureaucrat's opinion, he is a self-acknowledged member of AQ, hiding on a battlefield in the wild, tribal areas of Yemen.  He was attacked with the consent of the government of Yemen.  There really is no moral or legal problem here.  I admit, I have no idea what the deal is with his son.</div>

A drone is not a law enforcement device.  It is an instrument of war.  It must be thought of in the same sense as bombing, using a sniper, unleasing an artillery barrage.  Apart from the sniper, it is actually far more accurate, based on far better targetting observation, and therefore far less likely to cause many civilian casaulties than the prior instruments of war that it replaces.  There is the weird, to me, argument that it is bad, because use of a drone doesn't put an American serviceperson at risk.  That strikes me as a good thing.  Bombing is either moral or immoral based upon the cause for the war and whether the target being attacked is truly a military target and whether it is being attacked in a manner which minimizes collateral damage to the greatest extent.  Designing American fighter bombers to be very visible on radar, with no electronic countermeasures and nor armor protecting the cockpit, does not make the bombing more moral, by putting the pilot at greater risk and giving the enemy a fighting chance to kill him from the ground.  There really is not role for judges in this matter.  Congress should take the decision on when and where we fight.  They have authorized the fight against AQ and the killing of its members.  So, if anyone, anywhere, of any citizenship declares himself a member of AQ, the President is within his rights to order him killed, provided the country where he stands gives tacit approval.  If he is in enemy territory, that approval isn't necessary.</div>

For better or worse, in fact, civil liberties depend on public opinion.</div></blockquote><br />Again, this is crazy talk.  You can say that there is &quot;broad general popular support&quot; for the First Amendment, but the devil is in the details.  There certainly is not &quot;broad general popular support&quot; for the type of hate speech espoused by Westboro Baptist--just look at the amicus briefs filed by 48 out of 50 states (plus DC) and forty U.S. senators in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Snyder v Phelps</span> if you need a recent and non-Warren Court example--yet the Court correctly and overwhelmingly upheld their right to engage in it.<br /><br />By parallel, there is &quot;broad general popular support&quot; for Due Process, but that support greatly falls off once you talk about subjects like the War on Terror and &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;  That doesn't mean courts should (or would) abandon it.  In fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</span> certainly leads one to conclude that courts would not abandon it, even in the context of the War on Terror.<br /><br />Also, I haven't looked up any polls, but I'm confident in saying that there certainly isn't &quot;broad general popular support&quot; for a criminal defendant's right to a speedy trial in the Sixth Amendment (outside of the vague notion that if it's in the Bill of Rights it must be good), mostly because the overwhelming majority of Americans has no idea what that means or how it has been interpreted.  Yet the test set forth in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Barker v. Wingo</span> still holds true (mor or less), and there are plenty of cases where an indictment has been dismissed due to Sixth Amendment violations.  There's no groups outside protesting that a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights have been violated, and its highly unlikely that would there even be news coverage about it for obvious reasons (although one of the later trials of John Allen Muhammad is an obvious exception to that).</div></blockquote><br /><br />The Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts courts have probably lagged public opinion on civil liberties issues. What the Warren court giveth, the Roberts court can take away. Especially now that several justices don't even believe in the value of precedent. The madness is in relying on 9 people for the protection of our rights. <br /><br />If you're not willing to look at the actual data, I don't think you should call me crazy. <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2938958">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2938958</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1073565">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1073565</a><!-- m --></div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>TenuredVulture wrote:</cite>...conservatism in its traditional sense can be traced to two distinct ideas--one is a Calvinist view of man's fallen nature. Laws and institutions are needed because we are bad...<br /><br />An incoherence arises when this view embraces say market fundamentalism. Hayek was enough of a follower of Smith to see the shortcomings in this--he consistently argued that markets only functioned where certain conventions--call them business ethics--were followed. So, for instance, it's quite consistent with Hayek I think to believe that the problem with the financial wizards of today is that they lack those shared values--they don't adhere to those conventions. Consequently, they need to be regulated. But you could also argue that there needs to be regulation because of the inherent greed of fallen man...</div></blockquote><br /><br />This points to something I've always wondered about.  I know that this view, that we need laws because we are bad, is in its genesis considered to come from &quot;conservative&quot; thought.  Indeed, perhaps as &quot;negative&quot; proof of that assertion, one of the most oft-cited objections to the, loosely speaking, political opposite of &quot;conservatism&quot; - Communism/Socialism - is that while these systems would be wonderful in a &quot;perfect world,&quot; they don't really engage with the world as it is.  <br /><br />But what I see, and what the latter part of your post alludes to, is a contradiction of all of this.  It seems to me that, despite attempts by right-leaning folks to paint left-leaning folks as wide-eyed idealists with ideas impractical for the real world, it really is the opposite: the fundamental notion of modern conservative thought seems to be, &quot;The less statist interference, the better.&quot;  Conversely, the more the will and agency of the individual is maximized, the better.  That idea, however, seems to me to be the one that relies on the notion that people are basically good, not fallen, for any sense of feasibility.  If you take the most optimistic view of the individual, then yeah, of course, maximize the freedom for any individual to exercise his/her individual will.<br /><br />But if you think that there are enough bad individuals out there to quickly ruin the bunch, you're going to be more inclined to rely on societal controls (laws, the state, etc.) to check the power of the individual.  And that seems to be more in concert with the left's underlying political philosophy, rather than the right's.  And yet &quot;conservatism&quot; traces its beginning to Calvin's idea that indeed people suck, and need to be regulated at every turn.<br /><br />I think we might be bumping up against a certain kind of limit here - there are two distinct spheres in which people operate, broadly speaking.  The &quot;economic,&quot; and the &quot;social.&quot;  In the social sphere, I like to see people have maximum individual freedoms.  But I suspect that if you extend those freedoms to how people handle money, there are too many individuals inclined toward tremendous greed.</div>

I don't know if a majority of House Republicans support it, but comments have been pretty positive for what Rubio has been pushing. 9) Obama has been pretty good on education, but he's not representative of where his party is. Republicans at the state and national level have been more willing to press forward with aggressive reforms, and they're not married to teacher's unions like the Dems. 8) Neither party has been perfect on trade but Republicans are consistently more pro free trade than Democrats. 6) We're up for letting the sequester go through which is going to be a massive cut in defense spending. More than I'd like honestly. Certainly don't think it's crazy to suggest, since it appears to be happening. I said I wanted a bit less with a focus on some of the crazy cost overruns on various procurement issues. 1) The revenue line is high enough now after the fiscal cliff deal. Republicans continue to be the party that talks more about simplifying the tax code, has passed budgets at least pointing in the right direction. Democrats continue to get too caught up playing games with the rates for high earners and they absolutely will attack Republicans for cutting corporate tax rates even if reform raises the same amount of revenue or results in an increase. 5) Even if some Republicans , think it's pretty clear they're more in favor of expanding drilling sites. Not federal I don't think, but Dems are impeding fracking in NY and CA.

Mr Brennan found himself insisting that federal investigators could obtain intelligence from suspects even while granting them their rights, and explaining to an incredulous Mr Rubio that America could not order Tunisia to lock up a suspect linked to the Benghazi killings in Libya, when there was no evidence that Tunisian laws had been broken.</div></blockquote><br />LOL<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yet at the same time Democrats pressed Mr Brennan hard on his boss’s lack of transparency over the legal basis for drone strikes, following the leaking, a few days’ earlier, of a memo setting out the legal basis for such extrajudicial killings—a leak that finally prompted Obama officials to send the documents to the committee.<br /><br />Almost despite the best efforts of the senators, the hearing saw the beginning of a long-overdue argument about the impact on global opinion of hundreds of death-dealing American drones circling far-off skies, and the need for America to demonstrate a much clearer legal basis for those strikes. Before the hearings, a former commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, had told reporters that he was scared by the resentment provoked by drone strikes, and worried that the anger they stirred up was “much greater than the average American appreciates.”<br /><br />Yet some senators seemed most concerned about the idea that American drones being used to kill American citizens, as in a 2011 strike in Yemen against a suspected terror leader, the American-born Anwar al-Awlaki. The senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley of Iowa, expressed indignation on the same day as the Brennan hearing that his committee would not be sent papers explaining the killing saying: “Taking the life of an American citizen is a tremendous power and one that should not go unchecked.”<br /><br />In response to questions from Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the top Republican on the intelligence committee, Mr Brennan disagreed with the suggestion that it was better to kill terrorists with a drone than for the CIA to detain them. <span style="font-weight: bold">“I never believe it’s better to kill a terrorist than to detain him,” Mr Brennan </span>said.</div></blockquote><br />well, there's that, i guess</div>
