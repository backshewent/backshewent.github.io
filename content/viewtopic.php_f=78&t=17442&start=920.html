So, yeah, I'm on jerseyhoya's side here.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Hillary is up by 10% in some polls.  She's not going to win by 10 and neither would have Obama.  The country is too divided.  On a really good year, a Democrat might win North Carolina and Virginia.  Maybe even one red state like Indiana.  But that's probably it.</div></blockquote><br />This is stupid and wrong on multiple levels.</div></blockquote><br />No it's not.</div></blockquote><br />I mean, it is. If she's up by 10% in some polls, it shows she could realistically win by 10%+, and Obama, who is a lot more popular than she is, would likely win by more than whatever her margin is. I think the same is true for Biden, though he's less tested. <br /><br />Hillary seems pretty likely to outperform her national number in Virginia, so weird to include that as an example of a place a Democrat might win in a good year. Seems more likely to win red states like Georgia and Arizona than Indiana. <br /><br />Lot of levels of stupid and wrong.</div></blockquote><br /><br />If she wins by 10%, I'll admit I was wrong.  But I just don't see it.  The only way it happens is if Republicans stay home and don't vote, which I can't see.  But the electoral map will still not change much.  I think Trump gets at least 190 electoral votes.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well if she doesn't win by 10% it's partially because she's super unpopular. A more popular democrat like 2008 Obama might win by 10%. Because he won by 7+% against John McCain, who was significantly more popular than donald trump.  More people liking you causes more people to vote for you.</div>

So, contrary to what some may think, there are still lots of votes that can still break to either candidate. Hillary being up 5% but only having 42% of the vote is different than being up 5% and having 52% of the vote.</div>

			<div class="content">So all the worry about down ballot races seems to be being blunted by two things: <br /><br />1) There are not many competitive race, which is reasonable<br /><br />2) There is a strong desire to keep the presidential power in check, which sounds hopeful if not desperate.<br /><br />Everything I find seems extremely stilted one way or another (i.e., lobbying my opinion). Is there something that is more realistic that I should review?</div>

Both probably vote straight ticket unless there is an aberration of sorts or both candidates are very similar (being moderate)<br /><br />That leaves the 10-20% of &quot;independent/undecideds&quot; and let's face it, most of these folks don't pay much attention to politics, let alone decide that having a split house and presidency is a good thing.  They vote on things like personality, trustworthiness, familiarity, some hot button issue that affects them more that is probably tied to pork moreso than platform, or for the dumbest reasons that make your head scratch (like the last name is higher alphabetically).  <br /><br />to sum up, the direction the country is headed is often decided by people who don't pay much attention</div>
