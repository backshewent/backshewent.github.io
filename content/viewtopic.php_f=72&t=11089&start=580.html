			<div class="content">A BA at a minimum. Which isn't to say that a majority of four-year college graduates consistently vote Democrat--think this was (barely) true in 2008, but it never had been before--but the trend is in that direction, and the prominence of proud ignoramuses like Palin won't reverse that soon.
<br />
<br />My real point is that &quot;economic anxiety,&quot; the gut-churning worry about losing your job or not being able to meet basic expenses, might now be more remote for core Democratic constituencies (by which I mean the people that give money, volunteer, organize, etc) other than unions, than for Republican groups. Look at <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">unemployment broken down by educational attainment</a>, or <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="postlink">earning power</a>. The Great Recession mostly has been an abstraction for &quot;knowledge workers.&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />The Dem base is a bunch of different things. Blacks accounted for 23% of Obama's votes in a the 2008 election, so they'd have to be in the discussion right off the bat. Obama got 11% of his vote from Latinos. Working class, manufacturing unions might not play as key of a role as they did in the past, but Obama got 22% of his votes from union households, winning them 59-39. SEIU, teacher's unions, etc are the new key Dem pillars from the union movement. Obama got about 18% of his votes from people with postgrad education, winning them 58-40. So he won them by a lot, but not by as much as a lot of other key groups. Obviously the rich people matter more as donors, but they aren't the party's electoral base nationally.
<br />
<br />Obama won people who did not graduate from college 53-46% and people who did graduate from college 53-45%. Obama won every education segment, although did best among people who did not graduate from high school, followed by people with postgrad education, followed by people who graduated from high school. McCain's two best segments were college dropouts and college graduates.</div>

<br />
<br />You misunderstand me, I didn't say educated people, I said rich people. The people like you that are Dem should basically invite the rich people into your tent and give them control of the wallet (which means no helping poor people and no fighting dark people) as long as they leave all the social stuff to you. I contend that you'd have a very happy voting group. It would be about 10% of the nation, but at least it would make sense.
<br />
<br />Also, at what point Jersey would you leave the Republicans? How many O'Donnells would have to be selected in the primary? Would you be more forgiving if they won more in the general? Or would you start to think this party no longer looks like you?</div>

<br />
<br />It's hard to say. We're a long way away from that. I can see myself not voting for Palin if she is the nominee in two years, but as for not calling myself a Republican, I still agree with them on far more issues than I agree with the Democrats. And I think it's silly not to be a member of one of the two parties.
<br />
<br />I don't have a problem with the party nominating people more conservative than I am. The problem with O'Donnell is she's a wholly unimpressive person whose accomplishments to this point in life make the fact that she's a major party's nominee to the world's greatest deliberative body embarrassing. O'Donnell is the only tea party nominee who is <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> bad. Angle is probably next closest, but at least she's a former state legislator. Joe Miller, Mike Lee and Rand Paul have all done something worthwhile in their lives.</div>

<br />I'm not sure it does, or maybe I just don't entirely get what you're saying. I think what you're suggesting is that the two parties become indistinguishable on economic issues--both for free trade, deregulation, fine with inequality/concentration of wealth, unconcerned about negative externalities (e.g. global warming) but the Democrats are okay with two dudes getting hitched and little to no church attendance, and the Republicans are all about preserving precious bodily fluids?

<br />I guess you also might be saying that the Democrats embrace a sort of isolationism and leave the Republicans as the party of the neo-cons and security state fetishists. That at least would be a difference, though probably not one that helps the Democrats win elections.

<br />Not sure that making the Democrats more welcoming to the Koch brothers is that good of an idea for the country or even the Democrats--even if you dispute the premise PtK et al would offer that they're pretty much already there.</div>

<br />I've done a poor job of explaining myself, if PIP's the only one who gets me. But no, the party of the poor (white) people will be the Republicans.

<br />What you say makes sense if you neglect the last 70 years or so of American history. There's a lot more coherence to a liberalism based on a combination of JS Mill's social philosophy and Keynesian economics than you might think.</div>

The people like you that are Dem should basically invite the rich people into your tent and give them control of the wallet (which means no helping poor people and no fighting dark people) as long as they leave all the social stuff to you. I contend that you'd have a very happy voting group. It would be about 10% of the nation, but at least it would make sense.</div></blockquote><br />IOW, turn D into R sans the Jesus freaks and racists?</div></blockquote>

<br />I still think Texas is going to be a contested state sometime in the future.  Probably offset by state(s) getting more red though so I don't think its necessarily a political holocaust for republicans.</div>
